recommend read seen film form critical analysis friend fellow film critic ted prigge said review phantom menace even write review never mind fact waiting new star wars movie since seven years old never mind fact everyone internet already dissected discussed movie even released never mind much going movie terms plot action special effects long term story analyze every aspect would take lot time energy still would not cover everything also like ted reviews try review way different usual reviews instead write casually possible talking directly reader begin analyzing specific aspects film many general significant factors must considered get specifics film skip next four paragraphs made obvious last several years another trilogy films produced account missing initial three installments star wars series first films actually episode four not one george lucas creator series probably assumed people know first produced trilogy star wars empire strikes back return jedi actually second trilogy chronologically media interviews past explained movies made order not recall reasons new film writer director also assumed viewers least vaguely familiar storylines significant plot points first trilogy err second trilogy well know mean order review thorough many significant points must mentioned unfortunately may serve spoilers proceed caution critics note 1 one personal policy not intentionally analyze spoilers would like reviews able make sense reader viewing film reviewed would nearly impossible film justice without breaking rule critics note 2 reviewing film also breaks universal critics law reviewing movies roger ebert coined not movie many outside factors come play films plot significance part trilogy considering modern society would difficult not impossible simply review film completely autonomous story first catalog know film even going know young anakin skywalker grow become evil ruler darth vader also father luke skywalker lead successful revolution empire know obi wan ben kenobi trainer anakin ways force attempts become jedi knight would fail thus anakin would fall dark side also know something force kind universal force determines fate manipulated whose minds expanded enough believe feel jedi not know sure history ruling galaxy likely much longer complex government earth one fascinating aspects first three films seemed subtle definite order complexity also seems supposed familiar details story come thousands comic books paperbacks published years since movies ended notably details regarding emperor empire jedi senator last name palpatine not kept star wars paraphernalia years still way know details simply recognizing actor voice least phantom menace first chapter long saga one would assume basic groundwork would laid including history behind major factors series especially force jedi knights unfortunately film opposite simply builds top must history long detailed could never explained not liked aspect film one reasons falls short greatness going tell story beginning tell beginning possible trilogy complete could another trilogy episodes 1 3 clarify back story even digress said much yet not even touched specifics film necessary disclaiming elements go show vast story star wars series individual film get movie not unlike three come know love since late 1970s similarity films helps keep spirit series familiar time seems flaw filmmaking process since sometimes rings unoriginality basic story rather sorted complex even confusing times told army known trade federation set blockade around seemingly insignificant planet called naboo not given many details clarify back story federation purpose instead film opts get story moving quickly introduced two jedi master qui gon jinn neeson apprentice obi wan kenobi mcgregor two acting ambassadors sort hopes ending obvious hostility federation planets queen amidala portman leader federation alien called viceroy following orders strange mythical character older human man whose face body covered shadowed black robe hood wears referred lord sidious considering appearance especially creepy evil voice obviously one significant characters series sidious communicates viceroy digital transmissions never person clearly actual whereabouts something wants keep secret would also reveal identity never openly revealed film clear viewers feeling delve background next two films not take film long spring action within minutes hero jedi fighting lives films story begins move along film not one specific plot works manner films series get one mini plot adventure top another many mini plots within plots film would not describe gives movie hook films relied type storytelling limits technology time films screenplays also limiting sense limitlessness gives phantom menace unique traits already know film takes place least generation two original star wars trilogy means lot background unclear andor unexplained may cleared beginning vast epic story significant storyline involving discovery 10 year old anakin skywalker lloyd qui gon jinn introduction jedi council briefly summarize story jinn stumbles upon skywalker attempt buy parts queen amidalas spaceship damaged efforts free federation meeting tatooine mostly chance course jinn chalks force jinn feel skywalker great natural power force another sub plot involving bet skywalker fantastic race enter details significance begin reveal also provides new elaboration explanation force never mentioned fact seems something important upsetting never mentioned element seriously undermines mystical aspect force transforms something physical scientific completely unnecessary films third act major significant elements become tied together rather familiar execution plot funny reality star wars world seems embedded mythology new age like philosophy religion yet solution major conflicts series violence not technique not used movies real life situations countless times throughout history least spirit ultimate powers good versus evil fun exciting matter border cartoonish sometimes film appealing inner child basic reason entire saga exists become big part modern society phantom menace delivers exactly would expect star wars film succeeds well always never truly achieves greatness many things film seen done heart filmmakers concentrated bit story character limited film far bad least embraces

black cauldron army deathless ones everything hooking opening spectacular finale elmer bernsteins music also tells story perfectly dark yet calming manner animation surprisingly good considering film created darkest time studios even though occasional effects not quite good like ground opening black cauldron rises earth animation overall top notch overall film entertaining endeavor fans unfamiliar lloyd alexander chronicles prydain get kick one except young kids extremely scary scenes darker disneys films although consider stampede sequence lion king frollo observing esmeralda fires hell hunchback notre dame scary main reason film rated pg fans familiar lloyd alexander series recognize differences novel movie even though not ingredients true disney film film classic right deserves far
