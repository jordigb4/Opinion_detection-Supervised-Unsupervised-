frequent error categorization terrorist soldier common criminal soldier commits acts violence sanctioned one nation state another common criminal commits acts violence personal gain terrorist employs random violence means political end target nation not affect desired change policy violence continues fear resulting fact terrorist may strike anyone even total innocents anywhere anytime gives figure label edward zwicks siege explores possibility kind violence taking place right united states would think opening bit ripped right headlines arab terrorists kill american citizens abroad u responds retaliating sheik supposedly ordered attack however unlike real life tomahawk cruise missile strike bin ladens camp manufacturing facility film version depicts special operations troops kidnapping sheik ahmed bin talal retaliation terrorists bring fight new world unwittingly involved fbi assistant special agent charge anthony hubbard denzel washington works bureaus new york office one federal plaza investigating series bombings big apple encounters cia agent elise kraft annette bening also trying uncover information generally fbi charged problems inside u cia takes care problems international realm even spies countries limits cia long country hubbard therefore finds highly unusual agency spook nosing around considers territory two form tentative professional relationship hubbard becomes aware increasingly complicated series allegiances possibly illegal actions involving terrorism united states government original tagline patriot games never terrorist attack american soil however true pulled movies release sounded much like dare revisiting scenario foreign terrorists committing acts violence united states siege almost invitation shows kind turmoil could produced effective terrorist network set operations america admittedly terror wrought upon new york bit excessive going believe bombs going cause new yorkers jump backfire bus curtail shopping two thirds basic premise still valid liked fact film rises basic action thriller fare good guy g men bad guy terrorists exploring effects society law order provides possible hypothesis violent activity part arabs would escalate series hate crimes arab american population effort find terrorists civil liberties minority may violated government fact halfway film president authorizes declaration martial law within new york city liberties americans put risk although may actually side effect terrorist campaign demise social order america scary thought goal would not beneath many international terrorist groups throughout film maintains conflict hubbard wants use fbi pursue terrorists within letter law general devereaux bruce willis command army mind greater good would better served suspending law pursuing terrorists forcefully results fascinating debate appropriateness constitutionality declaration martial law invocation war powers act utilizing philosophy historical examples make points sides actually gets rather heady times credit screenwriters zwick lawrence wright menno meyjes not underestimate intelligence audience not know tone inflection something else denzel washington way spitting dialog makes whatever says sound great combined innate acting ability experience playing mid level authority figure makes performance siege convincing enjoyable annette bening gives one assertive portrayals female character seen recently chemistry shares washington palpable somewhat unfortunate characters fortitude broken certain point allows us watch bening play little range bruce willis pretty much relegated tough guy role always standing straight permanent scowl fixed upon face however tension exists devereaux hubbard major drive behind films development notable tony shalhoub plays fbi agent frank haddad lebanese immigrant role calls evidencing kind filial pride heritage contempt race might interfere integration american society difficult say least shalhoub naturalness almost reach touch perhaps best known role antonio cab driver nbc sitcom wings shalhoub gained notoriety dramatic abilities wonderful film big night whereas denzel washington seems edward zwicks favorite actor directed washington glory courage fire james horner seems favorite composer therefore found odd zwick chose prolific score writer graeme revell seven films year already horner siege realized film contained lot arabian themed music horners record shown propensity scores either neutral ethnicity irish sounding revell good job providing appropriate music punctuate key scenes allowing score enhance movie whole nowhere near intrusive films getting throughout year missteps siege found couple excesses takes example pretty clear throughout film meant thriller action flick unfortunately scene army cuts loose arab immigrants blatant display firepower explosions obviously meant sole purpose eye catching middle city no real opposition zwick even army use cobra attack helicopter shoot rockets building no farther 50 feet friendly troops verisimilitude really goes window point film also gets little preachy toward end focusing ability different races get along noble gesture film puts message across bit obviously flaws glaring not detract much otherwise good film makes think issues may not considered since history class

alien 3 alien film seen theaters saw 13 years old must admit not like course expecting aliens believe fault order appreciate alien 3 need see aliens also wipe away expectations predecessor james camerons aliens action film many people consider best series among group alien 3 extremely entertaining film critics bashed originality many thought final chase scene went long many others thought film much dialogue not enough action untrue film quite bit action dialogue essential well written chase sequence long not overly long creating quite bit suspense confusion perhaps watching alien 3 video helped big screen overwhelmed something normally not see dark film language extremely harsh always figured alien series rely smart dialogue instead moronic profanities not get wrong not saying films eliminate swearing film substitutes dialogue profane remarks gets rather distracting however since seeing realize swearing mainly aspect restrained hatred characters result alien 3s flaw albeit major one underdeveloped characters never really care get feeling many scenes cut order shorten length movie two characters liked course one lt ripley sigourney weaver although gotten know two films character dr clemens charles dance like inevitable occurs alien 3 begins exactly aliens left prologue alien 3 pure cinematic achievement director david fincher directed music videos chance alien entry without using single line dialogue unless count computer warnings fincher sets entire film impressive aspect fincher shows seconds film cutting title card see lt ripley little girl cryogenic compartments title shot alien egg title alien legs stretch air title first ten minutes learned everything order alien 3 proceed quite remarkable opening one remain mind long time face hugger hatched

mysterious acid eaten section ripley asks see dead bodies cremated cremation scene one powerful impressive alien films featuring monologue dillon charles dutton prisoner found god movie cuts back forth ceremony dogs demise one memorable moments speech reflects exactly going dog alien 3 succeeds fincher normally injects lot symbolism films easily see becoming next stanley kubrick alfred hitchcock fact mixture fincher knows exactly film film figure one directors complete control films alien 3 riddled symbolic speeches metaphorical images fincher creates best scenes entire alien franchise many people criticized finchers filming death scene ripley reveal nothing saying looking fake enjoy relish portrayal showing ripley fall slow motion nice touch actually not showing hit vat iron great deal symbolism derived feel would spoiled mood entire film actually shown splash molten iron however people seem want witness ripley die creates paradox character not want see die killed one surprises film not plan spoiling review every alien film comes several memorable moments seem stick forever alien course moment alien burst kanes stomach aliens showdown alien ripley machine alien 3 several memorable terrific shot involving alien ripley ripley pushed wall alien stands inches away not kill shocker later leads surprise ending fincher apparently loves use close ups actors faces michael douglas clown face game style shaving actors hair thing look faces many critics not like actors bald makes complete sense taken context plot alien 3 works take context story try compare predecessors finchers turn seems bit gloomy dark though not always bad thing plot pretty much rehash first two films major twists setup several different characters one one picked however first two tons arsenal especially camerons film alien 3 takes place planet devoid human life except run prison result no weapons found creates lot tension although must admit fincher could added lot suspense alien film alien 3 worst series extremely well made motion picture lot merits not unfortunate thing surrounding second sequel one dimensional characters never really emotionally involved screen characters hardcore criminals really could care less despite ripley central figure important care even though began act like one guys technical side film remarkable better two previous versions camerons version pumped action film massive artillary fincher uses brilliant camera angles terrific lighting moody sets cinematography alex thomson well done terrific chase sequence towards end movie confusion ending draws viewer confused actors chased around yellows reds oranges lights create dark mood create lot suspense shadows dance walls yet shadows could easily alien alien different predecessors time around swiftness alien quite intense camera likes take perspective alien racing characters sets quite incredible reminiscient nostromo alien narrow corridors labrynthine hallways well constructed sets appear future not far future one set pieces even aids destruction alien nothing surprising sigourney weaver turns yet another good performance equaling portrayal ripley aliens snubbed oscars one mainly film critical bomb reactions far realistic film crying loss little child risked life saving previous encounter quite touching really charles dutton strong performance one inmates brink actually caring charles dance turns nice low key performance result cared immediately lance henriksen makes brief appearance bishop ii entertaining aliens rest cast pretty stale though pete postlethwaite sticks due recent turns usual suspects lost world alien 3 rated r strong violence language sex although flaws alien 3 highly entertaining rich symbolism film reminds much fun spot

performance although character mostly left background first hour half towards end get bigger part male side matt dillon probably best giving subtle performance surprises every twist kevin bacon

film whole entire cast works wondrously together seem home even menage troi director john mcnaughton previously done critically acclaimed henry portrait serial killer constructed wonderfully twisty

protecting local businessman gabriel byrne actually possessed devil assassination attempt businessman crazed former priest leads girl satan christine york robin tunney recognizing elements murdered daughter christine including ownership music box apparently jericho swears protect devil faction priests looking kill many problems film hard know begin starting concept casting arnold role like mistake begin schwarzenegger persona not actor putting role contradicts usual strong personality bad idea arnold neither dramatic range speaking ability pull character tormented conflicting emotions words trying give dimension mistake harrison ford mel gibson even bruce willis could played role played noble flawed heroes not schwarzenegger several scenes attempt establish jerichos character one contemplating suicide another crying loss wife daughter even one devil tries tempt revealing christines location offering old life back none scenes really work arnie not task filmmakers would better making jericho strong confident character like terminator example likes schwarzenegger excelled one not believable way arnold plays supporting cast tries hardest gabriel byrne makes impact prince darkness suave confident acts like one would expect devil act problem script things make no sense later undermines powerful villain byrne performs arnold every scene together including aforementioned temptation bit problematic causes audience start unthinkable root devil byrnes speech bible overrated actually starts make sense mainly arnolds attempts refuting mostly tis not variety feeble best problem arnold win end nobody really cares kevin pollack plays jerichos security guard sidekick tries liven things comic asides like bad action movie sidekicks disappears hour robin tunney not given much except look scared fact supporting players good actors none save byrne given anything interesting performances aside would really hard enjoy film no matter starred action blockbuster no surprise worst thing script starts totally confusing explained not much utterly ridiculous devil coming new years eve 1999 exactly 1000 years year devil not 666 turns nutty priest accidentally read upside real year 999 add 1 beginning got 1999 not buy explanation not alone convoluted silly time method jericho locates christine york equally ludicrous christine see lives new york see not bad enough plenty bothersome stuff film not explained satan kill everyone passes street comes snuffing one drunk ex cop powerless impervious one kind bullet come not control jericho christine gregorian monks deal time zones prophecies clumsy attempt joke made never actually explained usually sort thing would not matter schwarzenegger flick mean not get started time paradoxes offered terminator movies time plot inconsistencies stand even usual action rarely exciting several predictable horror film clich present end days complete old black cat hiding cabinet bit not ever find cat gets formulaic possible uninterested scared close eyes precise moment boo come predictions rarely wrong grandiose action sequences utterly charmless partially not care characters due scripts pathetic attempts characterization setup also not make sense scene schwarzenegger gets thrown around room little old lady good chuckles not much else supposedly believe super strength virtue controlled satan script never sets scene merely silly none terribly exciting action sequences badly framed often hard tell happening first place not mention edited full incomprehensible mtv quick cut style scratching head rather saying wow cool end days not silly confusing also distinctly unpleasant watch devil apparently not operate subtle convince people kill fashion outlined bible instead enjoys killing people gruesomely broad daylight not make awfully predictable sort also means not single scene end days goes without unnecessarily graphic violence odd kinky sexual encounter yet another bit scratching head violence supposed shocking not good idea throw much movie audience goes numb scenes not connected reasonable means lot time stuff gets blown people get killed no idea reasons hell reasons let us blow stuff not cool nope not long shot film thoroughly unwatchable dull interminable unrelenting stupidity perhaps arnold needs make movies james cameron revive career not happening hack peter hyams end

actually fan original 1961 live action disney flick name starring hayley mills twice pair twins separated birth divorcing parents never come contact parents never meet everyone know feel remakes especially films happen enjoy fallacy unless going either capture exact spirit original something different maybe even wrack brain come gasp new idea remake not originally top viewing list actually quite opposite contemporary live action disney films not one favorties anyway usually unfunny alienating big fat bore least anyone age 11 iq 10 one however shockingly not bad fact actually good not original good great not necessarily retread original capture exact spirit become entertaining exact reasons original entertaining cute innocent fun pretty killer plot endlessly fun follow along lead star immensely appealing parents also immensely appealing repeating cute innocent fun nothing risque save plot idea separating twins denying truth years ominously selfish precisely point movie aimed directly either kids adults want remember original young adults want remember like kid personally somewhere second third vividly remember taste movies not weird diverse names godard kubrick not even glimmer right eye back would tune every sunday night couple years see abcs wonderful world disney would show live action andor made tv disney flick hour per week remember mom taking sister along friends mothers see rereleased disney films like lady tramp pinnochio sadly remember every single christmas without fail barage childrens animated half hour shows made exclusively christmas season would not dare missing even remember seeing made tv parent trap ii tv one night seen one saw original parent trap late childhood movie deals issue divorce deals disney ized version playful witty charming saw first time right never experienced part childhood would probably dismiss would probably new version movie not seen original perfect age watching could remember fun watch disney film divorce started get thinking possibilities seemingly perfect parents splitting affected adolescence also brushed fear smooth stroke pointed even fucked situations things could always work well manipulate things bit least better new version also charming way new cast contemporary feel first time awhile live action disney flick tone not corny condescending right moments would otherwise seem corny actually affecting safe kind way first time since original film kids actually know better foolish adults story basically classic repeated almost many times kurosawas seven samurai pair twins played lindsay lohan like played hayley mills original separated birth divorcing parents one annie sent live mother natasha richardson resembling mother vanessa redgrave ever noticed london lives parents devoted foppish butler simon kunz works swingin fashion designer grows refined classy also keen knowledge sports poker playing hallie sent northern california father dennis quaid live vineyard pseudo maid lisa ann walter grows rugged yet charming meet camp one annie wants go become rugged feud look similar thus tight competition results nasty pranks winds seclusion together private way

piercing scene like kiddie version hypodermic needle scene pulp fiction end summer comes switch hope best lindsay lohan not necessarily copy acting style hayley mills original comes appealing though add couple new things makes california twin little appealing london twin bit frank snobbish snotty proper original respectively also adds american british accent one one faking accent throughout really take notice see fake ones accents not exactly perfect also incredibly appealing not merely cute especially notable since first feature film know notorious child actors especially first films makes great protagonist helps supporting cast equally appealing dennis quaid fact not likable decade big dumb smile near cocky attitude made notable actor past not mr meg ryan ditto natasha richardson except not ever likable period two make winning couple maybe not winning maureen ohara late brian keith original still work film instead bickering ensued original film adds another dimension another angle characters amiss original opening credits see glimpses courtship qe2 fall quickly madly love eachother back together films smarmy scenes come actually sentimental great way not migraine inducing way many films brings new parent trap level entertainment not really existed since well original film years ago still money best live action disney flick time form intelligence wit makes plot points otherwise standard villainous love interest subplot gold digging sharon stone type played elaine hendrix deliciously tormented twins later film treat instead bore like original film transcends crap well could case point takes two starring olsen twins treats children smart ones adults silly ones not way around everything knows exactly charming without biting chew however comparison original could bit better certain scenes work well not nearly well worked original liked way parents fought past dilemnas fought falling love better liked watching two old flames getting back together bottle wine somehow feuding always cinematic pleasing mere reminscing lesson extracted howard hawks cary grant films yesteryear much film transcends mere cutedom compared original film almost drowns cutedom original though not gritty far stylized suitable adult audiences young audiences remake may never nearly great classic original film least knows treat source material dignity respect create virtually

ladies gentlemen 1997s independence day title starship troopers surprisingly entertaining id4 realize gave last years sci fi hit 4 star rating spell powerful first hour subsequent viewings feel independence day really not great seemed though still give positive review starship troopers hand mocking sense humor knowing perfectly well ridiculous may seem result starship troopers exciting energetic lively science fiction film fact probably could never get tired watching film starship troopers reminiscient star wars another kick ass space opera reinvented sci fi drama altogether starship troopers no star wars comes quite close easiest assessment would call film star wars 90s generous film perhaps science fiction film comes along mix humor romance effectively warring races essence science fiction equivolence pulp fiction easiest way write review film would compare science fiction films may starship troopers not quite original film persay director paul verhoeven gives film kick aliens asses style id4 style except forced likely cause smith major role new star wars simple basic plot mankind vs alien species alien species question bugs seemingly advanced civilization arachnid type insects however underlying morals starship troopers fleshed deadly accuracy sometimes morals buried bloody violence intense action scenes quiet moments realize starship troopers something tell us civilization likely morals overpowered quickly forgotten time movie ends doubt verhoeven intended film thought provoking film event film surprisingly average extremely refreshing watch sci fi war film actually root human side something independence day never achieved starship troopers begins satirical portrayal strange join army ads mixing web based interface summations events refreshingly original stating would like know short news bulletins give film immediate sense humor know not take seriously however also witness murder several troopers battle gory yet funny way witnessing slaughter film jumps back one year setup saw introduced johnny rico casper van dien carmen ibanez denise richards rico flirts carmen sending messages computer terminals school classrooms however carmen not interested rico becoming pilot however another classmate dizzy flores dina meyer eye rico unfortunately rico not interested dizzy setup rather cliched result setup still fun watch carmen signs become starship trooper result rico signs result dizzy signs everyone assigned certain position academy carmen gets pilot position wanted carl jenkins neil patrick harris psychic gets position training program rico left lowest class starship troopers mobile infantry main story follows rico trials relationships reality found watching space version melrose place better special effects hour film war begins sense tension grew audience watched film first hour may funny sometimes unintentionally setup grew care flat characters no matter hard tried not like characters gorgeous looks call superficial must following training sessions many dramas many mention troopers sent war bugs live planet klendathu planet consists dirt rock pretty much nothing else many dramas occur war finally troopers realize something behind bugs attacks sort intelligence masterminds defense troopers ordered locate brain capture hopefully left plot vague possible starship troopers not plot special effects gory violence director verhoeven known nudie film showgirls basic instinct returns sci fi days gave us good films like total recall verhoeven likes push envelope mpaa despite violence comic book feel gives film sense falsehood starship troopers extremely violent gore years event horizon r rating well deserved hopefully parents not allow 12 year old children see guess verhoevens target audience 18 25 male group film testosterone level charts chiseled men beautiful women despite superficial elements starship troopers also creates world made star wars successful watching film never second guess characters decisions seem perfectly clear thankfully no hero punching aliens face gives flat characters depth identify cast starship troopers quite annoying begin soon grow casper van dien chiseled facial features tan skin make girls swoon guys come across artificial fortunately van dien worst cast despite hard tries come real character dina meyer much better job fleshing character dizzy extremely likeable denise richards also good job scenes well done jake busey gary buseys son gives wonderfully funny performance provides one biggest laughs film neil patrick harris remember doogie howser little wooden slightly place rest cast however give good performance michael ironside gives best performance film teacher one arm performance rises rest perhaps character developed think ironsides presence screen unfortunately no particular cast member gives star making performance bad material could made many cast members stars director verhoeven main star film direction fast unrelentless never slows pace makes wild ride writer edward neumeier adapted screenplay book robert heinlein writing usually funny sometimes corny dialogue smart not smart not required know everything plot holes left unanswered thankfully not intended notice really not except one lingered mind quite amazingly wars romance going screenplay manages include surprising governmental issues fact governmental changes seem fairly plausible adds another layer story moral debate characters quite surprising find film genre even surprising amount humor included carnage not laughed loud even comedies oh special effects first rate starship troopers rated r graphic sci fi violence gore language nudity believe say not take young kids see film extremely violent fact probably violent film year

objectivity something seldom seen star wars reviews undisputed majority reviewers rate one best not best film times not usually difficulties hiding artistic snobbery author review must also concede

fascination unimaginable wonders happened long time ago galaxy far away perhaps rush felt minutes opening shots expectations already pumped serialised comic books novelisation read anyway watching star wars one important movie going experiences life also unmatched many years come movies managed strong impact like george lucas epic star wars not important movie millions fans probably share

science fiction began fading away although good dark cult quality sf continued filmed early 1980s science fiction continued considered synonym family entertainment ironically man responsible star wars

1930s 1940s yet obvious element would akira kurosawas samurai classic hidden fortress hand spent last two decades studying movie death would say inspiration star wars went even collective subconscious western civilisation hinted mild tolkien references others would find authors element within story star wars could seen anti establishment film young long haired easy going nature loving heroes fighting old uptight oppressive forces use supertechnology demonic purposes even historical social context star wars impressive strictly technical piece seven art george lucas direction good clever

good long since good old fashioned thriller mostly everything goes right audience wrong characters even longer since saw thriller actually shock cared characters not merely judged actually allowed human foibles flaws strengths emerge radiantly would saw least couple decades even far back great hitchcock thrillers though hardly comparing simple plan say rear window strangers train yet almost good simple yet strangely complex astonishingly rewarding instead moving plot point plot point merely laying might caught overtones instead concerns moral corruption depths greed protagonists go without ever judging either evil even immoral elegantly directed sam raimi yes simple plan concerns discovery crashed plane within bag full millions dollars upright moderately financially stable working man bill paxton dim witted brother billy bob thornton drinking buddy brent briscoe without anyone around possibility no one would come looking three debate debate finally reach decision yes keep authorities possible owners cash come looking generally not flaunt anything not want flaunt keep stored away custody paxton possibilites circumstance much diverse could endlessly play cat mouse authorities b could try fight rightful owners either villainous c could fight amongst simple plan though borrows little little tiff cops subplot involving alleged fbi agent chilling gary cole bit inside feuding austin powers would say not necessarily bag baby admired film makes far superior unique thriller successfully able cake eat effectively involves traditional thriller cliches like ones mentioned time involves deeply way characters become morally corrupt price pay think happiness black duffle bag steps taken neatly cover things subsequent steps go miserably awry film choses never loose sight covering things extent characters slowly losing souls humanity one early scene paxton thornton make trip back plane return money not look like stolen not bad idea thornton screws continuously throughout movie paxton major covering read homicide instead quick murder immeadiate hands washing raimi shows lengthy painful shot low angle onto paxtons face tries sift emotions reach conclusion similar shot afterwards paxton watching murder committing taking horror also wonderfully effective previous shot even better morally complex gut wrenching short probably best piece direction raimis ever done demonstrating sometimes simplest way something yields best results proof watch persona sex scene witness may best scene ingmar bergmans ever done film hardly stops follows completely rarely loses sight characters humanity depletion thereof yet also moves step step graceful method never feel like film merely stamping plot points story time comes paxton start becoming selfish thus diabolical aid pregnant wife played bridget fonda pal raimi soon horror situation escalating tragic heights least two grand shootouts least one may one greatest shootouts cinema history arrive not come masochistic delight cringe inducing horror one actually sinking chair mantra not streeming head fact film getting many comparisons coens superior forget fargo many similar moments manic insanity attributed major amount subtlety restraint directors direct hands would top distractedness imagine suppose robert rodriguez directing seeing evil dead films would hardly assume raimi would able pull something like although moments film easily dubbed raimi moments rifle shot notwithstanding instead raimi directs maturity gentle touch easily letting story characters co exist still letting traditional raimi elements come like offbeat comic touches particularly billy bob thorntons character jacob brilliant creation dim wittedness often hilarious film every line uttered greeted howling laughter authenticity performance strangely enough makes sure not totally laughing chuckles gets not necessarily ones full condescension thornton damn real jacobs multi dimensional character stupid see not much flaw strength character simplicity endearing many acts commits strong inner strength belief system primarily towards middle bud co conspirator begins make heavy waves concerning money final third film spends much time many touches upon character not thornton also screenwriter scott b smith adapting book way great particularly admired back story old high school girlfriend told thornton sincerity acception cruel story reversed near sweetness strength saddened character thornton absolutely brilliant performance far best performance ever given proof best character actor contemporary cinema not believe go back watch wonderful performance primary colors performance would nominated oscar not year easily able slip character make completely utterly believable brings much weight film character actors difficult picturing anyone else role rest cast great paxtons declining working man chelcie ross amiable town sheriff even fonda shows talents nicely complaints film plot almost simplistic times seems much like exercise like cruel test humanity still pays attention humanity involved occasional narration usually annoying narration used extreme caution especially trying set things andor express emotions not raimi watch first murder scene thing usually go wrong movie ending basically amiss not reveal way cruel much outsider set appearance plane not already much anyway film deals much intimately humanity characters involved wrong ending imagine character controlled ending otherwise like crime punishment police caught instead breaking confessing not comparing simple plan dostoevsky ending work despite protestations something incessantly nagging unsatisfying no qualms happy clam ignore go day despite mere claims make no mistake completely utterly edge seat throughout even sometimes curdling situations occured not kind gore factor thankfully minimal film places characters situations gives painful things overcome frankly not seen much like quite awhile least not since previous worthy hitchcockian masterpiece

taking place real time boring course leder not blame screenwriters michael tolkin bruce joel rubin crafted simplistic story gets worse time starts promising soon turns deadly audience anyway chock full cheesy one liners know going sex anyone else school stupid characters might think back 70s one subplots remotely interesting rest forgettable boring main plot outrageous not figure film supposed action drama sci fi put simply special effects film hit miss situation right 80 miss 20 hit scenes earth well done orbiting ship majestic comet huge mistake making laughable frightening concept even

brilliant water rushing towards land effective hits continent effects turn ridiculous cgi water used looks bad heard laughs audience shrieks fact may even recommend film want see bad effects actually get days think visual effects not improved along comes film show really one thing struck wrong note concerning mimi leders direction also influences actors leder loves show actors faces moments terror reminded another action director renny harlin die hard 2 cliffhanger harlin succeeds shows faces victims realistic situations leder likes flaunt peoples fears via faces instead coming sympathetic leder seems sadist one moment astronaut flying space enough warrant response audience leder wants go farther shows us persons face drifting space one cheapest ways ellicit emotional response audience one not going fooled another note leders film picks pace last fifteen minutes comet actually impacts pace pick emotional moments shown watch people cry loved ones obvious emotional mostly big trick

humanity instead uses flashbacks form contrast magic glam rock era boredom life glam rock participants 80s scenes dry deliriously melancholy equipped performance bale perhaps appropriately dull unengaging 70s scenes engaging though not mention addictively campy radiate gorgeous cinematography nicely accentuates vibrant colors era feel eerily lighthearted combined footage become not symbol

photography citys best areas etc fan not help feel visibly moved film opens usual credits plain white font black backgrounds old ironic standard playing soundtrack screen fills gorgeous dull gray sky word help spelled airplane beethovens 5th blasts soundtrack city seems stop take notice moment rather lovely look cut film crew shooting films hilariously banal key moment film lead actress film melanie griffith looking buxom beautiful ever realize somethings wrong life whatever terribly stale scene woody allen film great opening shots without heart sank soon got used fact new film not going great past works though record last years deconstructing harry came awfully close hell happened man could relied neurotic freshness cinema not become less funny films become less insightful like tossed together unfinished ideas bullets broadway though wonderful relies irony pull farce never totally takes mighty aphrodite full great moments lines really great story everyone says love great idea great film even deconstructing harry admittingly cheap way even top one truly hilarious films anything reception celebrity everyone tip allen fact time not audience critics wrong wonderful film celebrity yes good film marginally satisfying woody allen film instead creating great woody allen world created world subject knows bit fashioned film based almost entirely uninformed philosophy celebrities plays like series skits minor connections like la dolce vita without accuracy right amount wit correct personal crisis woody becoming insecure old age choses drop woody allen character world celebrities hang flaws scrutiny casting not brit actor kenneth branagh lead much said performance dead irritating makes one yearn real thing blah blah blah anyone actually knows woody allen character knows branaghs performance though featuring mannerisms stuttering whining lots hand gestures hardly warts impersonation branagh brings along little woody allen charm actually allows characters flaws apparent woodys flawed guy know love anyway really funny really witty really intelligent branaghs allen bit flat bad charm yes like still not sure really good person not character lee simon first seen set aforementioned movie hits extra actress winona ryder goes interview griffith takes childhood home makes pass denies sorta learn flashbacks lee sucked trying celebrity thanks mid life crisis appearance high school reunion since quit job travel journalist become gossip journalist sorts covering movie sets places celebrities congregate meet maybe sell script bank robbery movie deep personal crisis divorced wife several years allen regular judy davis continues quest sexual happiness boucing girlfriend girlfriend fling fling course film griffith comes escapades model charlize theron polymorphously perverse glad see allen using new jokes ha ha takes wild ride not different anita ekberg segment la dolce vita following safe relationship smart working woman famke janssen relationship almost assures success continued escapades ryder fancies story juxtaposed davis flips stumbles onto happiness runs handsome friendly tv exec joe mantegna lands job furthers career national status lee fumbling selfishly trying ensure happiness davis becomes happy become kind woman always hated loving without thing result film highs mediums mediums take film sitations scenes not exactly work not help pat allen back trying places really great scenes opening sequence theron good wished not ended banana scene bebe neuwirth droll ever perhaps best sequence romp hot hell teen idol brandon darrow played none leo dicaprio un dicaprio esque fans could sit film would never look way ignites screen intensity spares nothing showing character narcissistically tyrannical totally heartbreaking lee comes talk script read finds wild day ride go atlantic city watch fight gamble wind hotel room darrow gets flame gretchen mol lends one leftover groupies allens writing scenes good would almost recommend film almost really liked film despite fact mess despite fact film really needs good old fashioned rewrite allen still smart insightful film though jokes either stale misplaced seem cartoonish even environment allen still manages get across film not exactly celebrities may seem would extremely touch want celebrities equate celebrity hood happiness never get close enough actual celebrities see really happy may appear surface get close enough lee davis character lee obsessed phenomenon davis takes arms length never gets involved soon becomes one besides witty one thing no film allens great woody allen feel may not exactly fresh lively totally brilliant depiction subject yes part woody allens oeuvre merely blip no annie hall no shadows fog either goes prove no one

availability united states limited films must either purchased via pirates sought asian distributors tai seng subtitling copy slightly hard read letters white bit small although american release almost certainly dubbed review subtitled version please keep mind reading review help decide whether go see fair must admit never fond period piece martial arts movies ones set nebulous china distant not distant past perhaps seen filmed inferior stock either butchered dubbing illegible subtitling perhaps plots tend similar many cases nonexistant fact many get wrapped subplots seem forget main plot entirely minutes end matter might jackie chan films modern settings armour god rumble bronx etc tend spectacular stunts often involving large motor vehicles large explosions whereas period pieces simply martial arts said must turn right around say drunken master ii remarkable exception one better martial arts films seen quite enjoyed surprised well drunken master ii young man named wong fei hong played jackie chan master drunken boxing style kung fu learned style uncertain father wong kei ying ti lung steadfast opposition fei hongs practicing rather normal style kung fu apparently fei hong sort figure chinese folklore rather like paul bunyan americans heard little could quite well wrong leave analysis people know better one friends points character wong fei hong also featured upon time china movies not yet seen plot drunken master ii somewhat hazy plots many films watching jackie chan film odds not expecting something order war peace story seems revolve around evil foreigners spiriting away ancient chinese relics hence chinas cultural heritage overworking underpaying beating chinese workers nearby steel mill however plot merely serves framework main story film fei hongs perpetual struggle win girlfriend supplicate father keep pregnant mother played anita mui fighting keep getting beaten evil foreigner thugs macguffin drives plot precious antique jade imperial seal

revealed loyalist manchu officer trying recover seal stop evil foreigners attacked en masse another grand kung fu movie tradition think already spent time plot really deserves let us move real draw jackie chan movies action plenty martial arts action found movie course kung fu film expected however not another kung fu movie one jackie chan fight stunt choreography jackie chan genius primary martial arts style featured film drunken boxing form kung fu attempts draw adversary guard making seem like fellow using drunk purposes film least drunken boxers fight better actually intoxicated fine line drunk enough drunk stupor normal circumstances idea someone staggering around looking sloshed managing fight effectively even incredibly might seem rather stupid jackie pulls flair kung fu sequences intricate staging execution pointless try describe paper say fights especially big climactic fight end make movie worth watching another thing drunken master ii going stunt work even without motor vehicles well not counting train remarkable stunts film among things jackie dives balcony table crawls across hot coals not least twice count outtake shown credits quicktime movies stunts found www movie database unlike american films stunts not faked drunken master ii stars several veteran actors hong kong movie scene including jackie ti lung better tomorrow 1 2 anita mui heroic trio series

downfall make question loyalty friends goodfellas excellent example film represents work film genius full glory scorsese managed create vision effective complete despite full contradictions would ripped film apart hands less talented filmmaker world depicted film ordinary fascinating scorsese spares no effort show us violence hypocrisy inherent paranoia organised crime yet manages make seductive funny exposed two half hours film three decades criminal history based notorious real life events audience understands characters chose dangerous life paths trading superficial short lasting glamour prosperity criminal dullness poverty honest citizens scorsese also manages break viewers moralistic inhibitions showing truly revolting material scenes depict personal tragedies broken homes human depravity violence bloodshed murder uncompromising reality manner would make amusing funny audience use ironic soundtrack manipulative shots characters dialogue narrators commentary goodfellas represents new standards black humour would became popular years later tarantino era even not pay attention skills potentially disturbing material becomes eye pleasing entertaining admit scorsese displays talents truly original creative filmmaker first might notice unusual structure plot relatively minor subplot used movies ironic prologue instead single narrator scorsese switches second character narrator middle film switch back original shortly afterwards multiple points views terms narration various subjective shots lengthens ironic distance towards characters situation ironic distance comes extremely effective choice soundtrack nostalgia good old times illustrated easy listening 1950s pop songs depression paranoia bad times find expression neurotic rock songs late 1960s 1970s soundtrack effective used ironic comment almost pastoral easy listening tunes make strong ironic contrast scenes violence bloodshed however thing associated film couple continuos shots feature characters moving large rooms interacting dozens not hundreds people scenes although require great skill patience shootings became popular among directors 1990s fragmentary character screenplay not straight plot instead bases film series loosely connected vignettes gives another interesting opportunity scorsese uses structure film experiment successful experiments hilarious day life segment near end film another essential element goodfellas large superb collection great acting talents respectable among robert de niro character happen quiet business like member criminal trio gets overshadowed two friends colleagues joe pesci deserved oscar supporting role homicidal psychopath tommy lines including ad libs probably represent memorable element film ray liotta although equally talented perhaps not look best choice narrator nominal hero film liottas henry hill looks somewhat hollywoodised glamorous among bunch low level street thugs liotta hand improves general impression realistic menacing portrayal drug addiction lorraine bracco hand effective believable karen hill wife gradually descends moral cesspool husband paul sorvino also effective patriarch mafioso among supporting

historical epic genre almost banished hollywood early 1990s many critics scholars importantly film producers thing past something could attracted crowds era black white television non cgi special effects 1995 case dances wolves five years ago came man decided use energy talents actor producer director order revitalise particular genre case dances wolves awarded effort oscars name film braveheart name director main actor mel gibson plot chronicles life scottish warlord folk hero william wallace 1272 1305 time english king edward longshanks played patrick mcgoohan almost completely subdued entire british isles including scotland whose proud inhabitants subjected ius primae noctis various forms humiliation oppression english knights although english killed father many years ago young scottish commoner william wallace played mel gibson not care politics wants peaceful life new bride murron played catherine maccormack murrons death changes wallace takes arms together small dedicated band followers begins guerrilla campaign would systematically destroy almost every english garrison country time people join ranks 1298 wallaces rag tag army scores surprising victory english knights battle stirling bridge newly freedom endangered internal squabbles scots especially nobles pretender robert bruce played angus macfadyen would not like simple commoner national leader braveheart second film directorial career mel gibson would not fair compare better known genre classics directed david lean anthony mann however even apply criteria braveheart decent historical epic takes new refreshing approach genre noticeable element approach naturalism older hollywood films set medieval europe used give fairytale like vision picturesque castles splendid costumes knights shining armour gibson shows us extremely unpleasant world poverty feudal injustice might made right life hard short brutish general unpleasantness especially underlined scenes battle hand hand combat naturalistically displayed gory details never seen since verhoevens ultra naturalistic flesh blood compared naturalistic approach old hollywood epics look like stage plays braveheart also employs humour right places not make bloody realities medieval british isles bearable sensitive audiences also underline earth atmosphere different previous historical epics makes braveheart larger life protagonist mel gibson obviously invested plenty energy talent bringing mythical figure william wallace result character 15th century poems transformed superhuman resembles late 20th century comic book hero wallace superior enemies physically mentally yet able show sensitive vulnerable side naturally character based epic poems historical accuracy going drain case almost every historical epic hollywood 1990s however even not particularly care history willing give poetic license scriptwriter randall wallace might think went top idolising wallace especially second part film scottish superhero manages seduce princess isabel played sophie marceau make child disbelief hardly suspended final scenes not effective mel gibson actor truly wonderful also helped small army good british irish actors memorable patrick mcgoohan whose cold calculated evil medieval monarch one effective villains seen contemporary cinema brendan gleeson would later become famous role boormans general also good wallaces trusted companion well ian bannen effective leprosy stricken king john balliol david oharra entertaining wallaces irish ally angus macfadyen brings lot anxiety conscience stricken character robert bruce women film rather thankless roles especially marceau one dimensional french princess catherine mccormack wallaces wife interesting eliminated picture early technical point view film also good photography john toll brings lot scottish natural beauty screen hand musical score james horner employs much modern day instruments period piece set medieval times although mostly welcomed critics audiences alike braveheart often criticised homophobia forms extreme conservatism main reason fact gibson among many historical facts chose faithful related sexual orientation longshank son prince edward played peter hanly not presented villain also one less competent villains camp portraying homosexuals villains inferior heterosexuals almost unforgivable sin politically correct hollywood make things even obvious good guys film total opposite effeminate incompetent edward rugged macho men mountains practical efficient tend employ conservatives common sense instead fashionable theories ivory tower liberals however although message film might look right wing owes leftist ideology various national liberation movements 20th century according ideology oppressed classes workers peasants better suited fight national freedom members less lose struggle radical less willing make compromises efficient hand privileged classes aristocracy bourgeoisie likely betray cause freedom cahoots foreign oppressors order keep privileges marxist worldview presented braveheart without subtlety end whether audience patient enough discover hidden meanings simply wants enjoy entertaining historical epic braveheart adequate choice fans recently resurrected genre

witnesses stigmata attacks dedicates finding going eventually begins suspect boss cardinal houseman jonathan pryce concealing something could bring catholic church turns dead priest working translation fifth gospel excommunicated new rupert wainwright music video mean film stigmata sort film starts ok gets worse indeed would good music video interesting five minutes not sure wainwright trying prove endless parade slow motion double exposure extreme close ups whoaaaaaa fact swelled head director hollywood yes film school camera trickery interesting little eventually becomes headache inducing film needed second audio track played dialogue wainwright screaming audience see look ex cellent dir ect maybe would explain decided start half scenes slow motion shots water dripping reverse included random superfluous shots egg frying ooh scary underlying meaning behind camera trickery not see thought safe get involved story comes double exposure shot two patricia arquettes collapsing

cackle get pretty depth cardinal houseman afforded trust not revealing anything telling pryce turns villain worse faced dull characters prospect annoying camera tricks loud music jammed throats contend story starts one direction veers another another ends totally incomprehensible first film not even bother explain simple plot details frankie get stigmata merely touching rosary come atheist

critics call better film believe say completely original motion picture antz however upped ante considerably disneys bugs life not due another two months dreamworks seems received better end deal beating disney satisfied audiences thirst computer animated films not let fool disney definitely not scared past two years competitions broken studios 1997 volcano duel opinion dantes peak came way

impact even interesting one beloved studio disney goes newcomer dreamworks prevail time tell sure mr mouse nothing fear may sound like not like antz contrary would put toy story due pg rating many parents may put dialogue not appear disneys version dialogue antz pushes envelope family oriented film sexual innuendoes profanity pop occasionally makes dreamworks animated feature geared adult crowd humor also written especially adults though many kids laughing theater attended type film made families often entertaining kids entertaining parents antz begins hilarious monologue seems meld woody

stunning though may flashbacks starship troopers contained similar sequence however antz 1997 film production around time similarities merely coincidence second half film revolves around zs kidnapping bala search mythical place called insectopia ant boss food wants adventures z bala get surprisingly high tension especially one involving magnifying glass looming targets like spaceships independence day fact going assume producers referenced id4 intentionally ants look awe beam fire blasts ground visually exciting rush adrenaline not fooled little kids not see may try copy seeing antz vowed never intentionally step ant hopefully children learn killing ants rather cruel animated film antz probably best find date visually stunning dreams may come best aspect animation fact characters not limited gravity take ridiculous situations make seem plausible one great moment involves mass worker ants bunching form wrecking ball animation perfect virtually see every single ant ball however exhilarating scene involves bala getting stuck bottom young boys shoe truly great example film making finest computer technology animators carefully made ants faces look similar actors providing voices best example would barbatus danny glover one point even see pores face although doubt ants pores barbatus also touching rather gruesome scene final words z without body young kids may disturbed site dismembered head good deal humor derived appropriate adults course disneys bugs life looks good not know able best dreamworks newest animated feature terms animation not dreamworks done something no studio could go head head big mouse knock yes anastasia good not nearly good even worst disney vocal talent always essential animated feature antz one best line ups seen since toy story fact far exceeds one woody allen always funny transcends done past years without body comic timing noticeable thing fact pretty sure writers let improvise lot lines sharon stone bala shows comic ability though part stone works best dramatic actress sylvester stallone teamed stone beginning solidify statement wants actor not typecast action star snub oscars last year stallone proving serious comedic illustrated actor gene hackman superb gruff talking general almost another take crimson tide persona christopher walkin probably noticed voice many people remember hits batman returns anne bancroft minimal role effective nonetheless danny glover small role good job dan aykroyd jane curtin also lend voices two lovesick euro trash bees unrecognizable especially aykroyd jennifer lopez plays worker ant falls love weaver although people not recognize voice either many people recognize grant shauds voice foreman played miles tv show murphy brown definitely huge cast high profile names definitely help grosses course probably tell lot 60 million budget went also directors eric darnell lawrence guterman relative newcomers though guterman direct 1994 feature headless show incredible talent type picture tense times funny throughout two hold film together like professionals screenplay todd alcott chris weitz quite simple plot contains lot subtlety makes film suitable adults kids delight animation parents laugh heartily humor go young childrens heads mean not take kids see not lot fun watching one great themes given us part social commentary part romance story part moral drama antz gives everyone something talk whether animation discussions individualism community thankfully not subtle either aspects antz rated pg mild language intense action sometimes language pushing limits family movie violence keep kids home battle scene ants melting acid bugs speared death magnifying scene shows ant disintegrate beam sunlight sexual innuendos perfect choice wholesome fun theaters doubt many children understand sexual innuendos unless old enough still advisable leave really young children home confused enough take kids recommend seeing film likely enjoy

people enjoy science fiction often faced unpleasant surprises due improper labelling novels stories comic books movies often science fiction aficionados find material previously labelled science fiction pure fantasy supernatural horror rather simple techno thriller cases mistakes understandable genre boundaries never clearly marked believe really cases movie labelled science fiction actually happens straight historical epic thing occurred former yugoslavia fifteen years ago national distributors gave treatment right stuff 1983 film directed philip kaufman mistake distributors could explained fact official poster film features men space suits right stuff film not even fiction based non fiction book tom wolfe covering early years american space program plot film begins 1947 people heard edwards air force base major test site experimental planes major aim test flights determine ability manned aircraft reach 1 mach speed thus break sound barrier many pilots tried achieve goal many paid lives bravado one quiet pilot chuck eager played sam shaped succeeds thus gives example whole new generation test pilots determined enter history books breaking new speed records ten years later soviets launched sputnik marking beginning space age order regain national prestige us government decides first send man space best air force navy marine pilots recruited program not yeager lacks college education desired american image one critics polls right stuff named one among top 10 films made 1980s high position could explained fact kaufmans film looks quite atypical time three hours length epic scope looked suitable 1950s 1960s age hollywood used make films larger life real reason lies fact made truly remarkable talented filmmaker philip kaufman created reputation 1970s using opportunities golden age order create original memorable movies right stuff last swan song era producers allowed directors spend big bucks unusual risk taking artsy projects right stuff unusual lacks many standard elements hollywood film plot almost non existent not coherent story featuring many interesting incidents anecdotes shifts focus old generation test pilots embodied yeager new generation astronauts film also lacks conventional protagonist yeager also appears small cameo remains true hero film equal time exposure also given astronauts wives making movie ensemble piece gave opportunity kaufman use multitude great acting talents specialised bit character roles sam shepard great yeager war hero whose greatest achievement breech sound barrier remained obscured history books probably due modesty surface lacks personality compared hyped fortunate astronaut colleagues shepard gives texture character subtle gestures phrases shepards performance followed great acting ed harris clean cut marine future politician john glenn young dennis quaid fine arrogant fighter jock gordo cooper arrogance mirrored friend tragic figure virgil grissom superbly played fred ward always reliable character actor scott glenn provides comic relief navy aviator arguably first american man space alan shepard kaufman left room female talents excel barbara hershey pamela reed veronica cartwright mary jo deschanel great pilots wives royal dano also impressive menacing figure preacher memorable performances belong donald moffat vice president lyndon b johnson jane dornacker nurse murch great acting talent assembled film mirrored kaufmans superb direction notable methods kaufman uses order suggest passage time beginning film shows test pilots living middle desert virtual unknowns far away strict rules discipline everything seems natural yeager indulge horse riding yards away fastest precious aircraft world setting quite normal important technical problems solved simple chainsaw test pilots not report ribs broken important flights times changing ww2 alliance ussr replaced cold war natural pilots like yeager must replaced disciplined conventional pilots entire lives become focus media frenzy job subjected strict rules meticulous plans must fight bureaucrats publicity seeking politicians uncaring scientists like former nazi rocket expert werner von braun played scott beach preserve basic human dignity contrast underlined beautifully edited sequence yeager conducts final spectacular test flight absolute obscurity mercury astronauts receive fame fortune although even going space contrasts similar effects achieved kaufmans superb use poetic movie language editing great photography caleb deschanel provides many memorable scenes like funeral desert astronauts suits walking slow motion image would copied many latter films although kaufman enjoyed support nasa american military provided authentic locations period equipment still use special effects order simulate space flights effects excellent still fool audience accustomed cgi real footage earth outer space another fine contribution film oscar awarded musical score bill conti still tremble excitement every time hear accompanied use holst debussy songs used background also provide authentic atmosphere historical period film great cult status well deserved minor flaws mercury astronauts not fleshed enough although played fine actors like lance henriksen film also lacks proper closure hand logical conclusion film landing moon would require film six hours long also critics prone attack film amerocentric hard russians portrayed evil monsters line virulent cold war rhetoric reagans america contemporary interviews kaufman defended approach claiming wanted make film authentic possible order portrayed russians not real life perceived americans early 1960s time passed not see astronauts heroes age widespread satellite communications routine space missions men women space suits seen mere maintenance workers young boys want astronauts grow film sentimental reminder times future began perhaps could encourage least follow mercury astronauts footsteps seek new frontiers sky even decide stay earth could still appreciate right stuff extraordinary piece cinema
