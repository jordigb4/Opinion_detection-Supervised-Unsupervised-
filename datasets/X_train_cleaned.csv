thought stigmata would worst religiouslyoriented thriller released year turns wrong stigmata merely boring selfimportant end days completely inept fronts silly incomprehensible endlessly stupid mess guy like grew watching arnold schwarzenegger best extremely disconcerting see big man ended first time recent memory arnold action movie batman robin not count no fun end days major stinker movie opens vatican city catholic priests observed ancient prophecy says girl born night satan targeted impregnation impregnates midnight december world destroyed pope orders protection girl though priests believe ought killed new york night girl born fulfill prophecy twenty years later meet jericho cane schwarzenegger suicidal excop drinking problem working security guard hire protecting local businessman gabriel byrne actually possessed devil assassination attempt businessman crazed former priest leads girl satan christine york robin tunney recognizing elements murdered daughter christine including ownership music box apparently jericho swears protect devil faction priests looking kill many problems film hard know begin starting concept casting arnold role like mistake begin schwarzenegger persona not actor putting role contradicts usual strong personality bad idea arnold neither dramatic range speaking ability pull character tormented conflicting emotions words trying give dimension mistake harrison ford mel gibson even bruce willis could played role played noble flawed heroes not schwarzenegger several scenes attempt establish jerichos character one contemplating suicide another crying loss wife daughter even one devil tries tempt revealing christines location offering old life back none scenes really work arnie not task filmmakers would better making jericho strong confident character like terminator example likes schwarzenegger excelled one not believable way arnold plays supporting cast tries hardest gabriel byrne makes impact prince darkness suave confident acts like one would expect devil act problem script things make no sense later undermines powerful villain byrne outperforms arnold every scene together including aforementioned temptation bit problematic causes audience start unthinkable root devil byrnes speech bible overrated actually starts make sense mainly arnolds attempts refuting mostly tis not variety feeble best problem arnold win end nobody really cares kevin pollack plays jerichos security guard sidekick tries liven things comic asides like bad action movie sidekicks disappears hour robin tunney not given much except look scared fact supporting players good actors none save byrne given anything interesting performances aside would really hard enjoy film no matter starred action blockbuster no surprise worst thing script starts totally confusing explained not much utterly ridiculous devil coming new years eve exactly years year devil not turns nutty priest accidentally read upside real year add beginning got not buy explanation not alone convoluted silly time method jericho locates christine york equally ludicrous christine see lives new york see not bad enough plenty bothersome stuff film not explained satan kill everyone passes street comes snuffing one drunk excop powerless impervious one kind bullet come not control jericho christine gregorian monks deal time zones prophecies clumsy attempt joke made never actually explained usually sort thing would not matter schwarzenegger flick mean not get started time paradoxes offered terminator movies time plot inconsistencies stand even usual action rarely exciting several predictable horror film clich present end days complete old black cat hiding cabinet bit not ever find cat gets formulaic possible uninterested scared close eyes precise moment boo come predictions rarely wrong grandiose action sequences utterly charmless partially not care characters due scripts pathetic attempts characterization setup also not make sense scene schwarzenegger gets thrown around room little old lady good chuckles not much else supposedly believe super strength virtue controlled satan script never sets scene merely silly none terribly exciting action sequences badly framed often hard tell happening first place not mention edited fullon incomprehensible mtv quickcut style scratching head rather saying wow cool end days not silly confusing also distinctly unpleasant watch devil apparently not operate subtle willconvincepeopletokilleachother fashion outlined bible instead enjoys killing people gruesomely broad daylight not make awfully predictable sort also means not single scene end days goes without unnecessarily graphic violence odd kinky sexual encounter yet another bit scratching head violence supposed shocking not good idea throw much movie audience goes numb scenes not connected reasonable means lot time stuff gets blown people get killed no idea reasons hell reasons let us blow stuff not cool nope not long shot film thoroughly unwatchable dull interminable unrelenting stupidity perhaps arnold needs make movies james cameron revive career not happening hack peter hyams end days might camp value not top overly pious ending nobodys going buy movie going serious filmmakers come decent script going campy arnold not taking damn seriously not actually see put cross character not sad sack stands end days bad movie awfully gloomy one

friend film school made two minutelong film one classes includes staged anal rape scene done two guys shot shadow incident banana used instrument penetration sick watching one admittingly hysterical moments ever witnessed sure may bad taste hell bad taste something may offensive riotously amusing rest caligula film features incest necrophilia beastuality anal rape homosexual felatio sexes elaborate lengthy orgies greasedup fist forced mans rear wine poured man urinary tracts tied penis chopped fed hungry dogs etc etc etc could well respectable film could following not occurred events graphically shot clear view tone not trying shock comically well show historical accuracy film million dollar production lavish sets rather impressive cast whopping hour running time produced funded none bob guccione owner penthouse magazine caligula comes across hysterical dramatic picture since plan outer space underneath sense everything film not accurate justified also brilliantly entertaining not really fact film features aforementioned disgusting moments actually believes dramatic weaponry no film discarded content film never old cliche goes bash film content glancing biggest obvious problem caligula nothing overdramaticized bullshit start finish without second credibility mammoth running time caligula allegedly tells true story evil roman emporer name man insanely decadent assasination came blessing guess even though almost every single roman emporer assasinated well much reasons film opens wrong note course quote mark appearing image graces screen using overused passage shall profit man gain whole world dlose soul depite fact opening scene film emporer emporer fucking around sister field suppose one lose soul one soul first place plot incomprehensibly done anyone else make caligula disastrously played great malcom mcdowell performance opposite performance clockwork orange next line throne not wait current emporer tiberius peter toole ditto performance lawrence arabia grandfather die kills ascends throne abuses position marries woman helen mirren retains dignity actor not exactly acting not sleep sister dreadful teresa ann savoy pretty naked willing hop sack mac anyone asks hop abuses position little little little believe invades england killed filler instead recounting life supposed guccione claims ultimate portrait decadent pagan rome complete orgies vicious deaths lots nudity instead historical accurate film really really wants instead becomes gucciones twisted masturbatory image could like oh not great loved sex killed people disgustingly would not great could make couple bucks selling shit accuracy even though blatantly real bad porn completely convinced not mean not show roman orgy spend good ten minutes examining every single facet makes not disgusting vile whatever adjective want use describe film film entire feel going not felt also sloppiest expensive movie time sets lavish blatantly innacurate wonder no historian wanting name film explains not matter since cinematography dark wonder light meter used making not dark ugly plain dark camera operation also worst ever seen entire life not film hold record unnecessary zooms one single shot ever often camera lose subjects pan around till find focus editing sloppy scenes absolutely impossible follow no writer speak hell mean adapted original screenplay gore vidal nevertheless dialogue shit laughably bad not good faith believe anyone iq could say straight face favorite line caligula inquires doctor health dying tiberius could go moment care could last year music film mostly prokofiev khachaturian use gorgeous adagio spartacus phrygia ad nauseum used attempt give film emotion instead feels shipped elsewhere orgy scenes one infamous lesbo scene penthouse pets lori wagner aneeka dilorenzo result reshoots guccione obviously removed everything else film adds embrassment every five seconds film cuts random nudity afraid audience would forget film rated john gielgud represents voice sanity walking around brief role constantly mantra going kill agent going kill agent hours making caligula exciting enriching three hour college lecture class twice deliriously annoying guccione pursuit historical accuracy instead made film painstaking arduous task watch entirety doubt anyone sit hour without irreversible psychological damage throughout entire film presence guccione easily felt standing edge screen pretentiously looking upon us saying look get away not like prig worse know nothing history uh huh clear difference historical accuracy something artistically good film showed roman decadence something perhaps liberating could not last would probably make good film using historical accuracy licence get away kind disgustingfordisgustingnesssake acts total total bullshit say guccione makers film lost kind touch either entertainment eroticism developed pathetic sadistic taste judging film film came called cook thief wife lover magnifcent film legendary cult director peter greenaway also starring helen mirren deals graphic sex heartstopping violence gore even little cannibalism good measure film not never patronized viewers also handled way shocking yes also bizarre way entertaining totally involving real characters real situation best passion right amount restraint not get fact going offensive many film achieved everything wanted since retained status one cult films not popular actualy good everything caligula might alas not

historical epic genre almost banished hollywood early many critics scholars importantly film producers thing past something could attracted crowds era blackandwhite television noncgi special effects case dances wolves five years ago came man decided use energy talents actor producer director order revitalise particular genre case dances wolves awarded effort oscars name film braveheart name director main actor mel gibson plot chronicles life scottish warlord folk hero william wallace time english king edward longshanks played patrick mcgoohan almost completely subdued entire british isles including scotland whose proud inhabitants subjected ius primae noctis various forms humiliation oppression english knights although english killed father many years ago young scottish commoner william wallace played mel gibson not care politics wants peaceful life new bride murron played catherine maccormack murrons death changes wallace takes arms together small dedicated band followers begins guerrilla campaign would systematically destroy almost every english garrison country time people join ranks wallaces ragtag army scores surprising victory english knights battle stirling bridge newly freedom endangered internal squabbles scots especially nobles pretender robert bruce played angus macfadyen would not like simple commoner national leader braveheart second film directorial career mel gibson would not fair compare better known genre classics directed david lean anthony mann however even apply criteria braveheart decent historical epic takes new refreshing approach genre noticeable element approach naturalism older hollywood films set medieval europe used give fairytalelike vision picturesque castles splendid costumes knights shining armour gibson shows us extremely unpleasant world poverty feudal injustice might made right life hard short brutish general unpleasantness especially underlined scenes battle handtohand combat naturalistically displayed gory details never seen since verhoevens ultranaturalistic flesh blood compared naturalistic approach old hollywood epics look like stage plays braveheart also employs humour right places not make bloody realities medieval british isles bearable sensitive audiences also underline downtoearth atmosphere different previous historical epics makes braveheart larger life protagonist mel gibson obviously invested plenty energy talent bringing mythical figure william wallace result character th century poems transformed superhuman resembles late th century comic book hero wallace superior enemies physically mentally yet able show sensitive vulnerable side naturally character based epic poems historical accuracy going drain case almost every historical epic hollywood however even not particularly care history willing give poetic license scriptwriter randall wallace might think went top idolising wallace especially second part film scottish superhero manages seduce princess isabel played sophie marceau make child disbelief hardly suspended final scenes not effective mel gibson actor truly wonderful also helped small army good british irish actors memorable patrick mcgoohan whose cold calculated evil medieval monarch one effective villains seen contemporary cinema brendan gleeson would later become famous role boormans general also good wallaces trusted companion well ian bannen effective leprosystricken king john balliol david oharra entertaining wallaces irish ally angus macfadyen brings lot anxiety consciencestricken character robert bruce women film rather thankless roles especially marceau onedimensional french princess catherine mccormack wallaces wife interesting eliminated picture early technical point view film also good photography john toll brings lot scottish natural beauty screen hand musical score james horner employs much modernday instruments period piece set medieval times although mostly welcomed critics audiences alike braveheart

dialogue not appear disneys version dialogue antz pushes envelope familyoriented film sexual innuendoes profanity pop occasionally makes dreamworks animated feature geared adult crowd humor also

producers referenced intentionally ants look awe beam fire blasts ground visually exciting rush adrenaline not fooled little kids not see may try copy seeing antz vowed never intentionally step ant hopefully children learn killing ants rather cruel animated film antz probably best find date visually stunning dreams may come best aspect animation fact characters not limited gravity take ridiculous situations make seem plausible one great moment involves mass worker ants bunching form wrecking ball animation perfect virtually see every single ant ball however exhilarating scene involves bala getting stuck bottom young boys shoe truly great example film making finest computer technology animators carefully made ants faces look similar actors providing voices best example would barbatus danny glover one point even see pores face although doubt ants pores barbatus also touching rather gruesome scene final words without body young kids may disturbed site dismembered head good deal humor derived appropriate adults course disneys bugs life looks good not know able best dreamworks newest animated feature terms animation not dreamworks done something no studio could go

best dramatic actress sylvester stallone teamed stone beginning solidify statement wants actor not typecast action star snub oscars last year stallone proving serious comedic illustrated actor gene hackman superb grufftalking general almost another take crimson tide persona christopher walkin probably noticed voice many people remember hits batman returns anne bancroft minimal role effective

attention religious people not take far movie robin williams continuously impressed dramatic performances comedic roles suffering comedy perfection makes stuff confined screenplay not quite effective drama really strong point see doubtful get another oscar nomination would not really mind real surprise annabella sciorra impressed last year cop land may breakout role may garner much needed

artsy compete coppolas influence mafia portrayals movies seventeen years later scorsese returned mean streets new york another film dealt darker side american organised crime film goodfellas epic black comedy today considered one best influential films goodfellas owes initial success popularity fact based true story told bestseller book wiseguy nicholas pileggi would cowrite screenplay film

wiseguys gradually begins fall apart tommys unpredictable outbursts homicidal violence jimmys reluctance share part loot partners finally henrys drug habit would lead downfall make question loyalty friends goodfellas excellent example film represents work film genius full glory scorsese managed create vision effective complete despite full contradictions would ripped film apart hands less talented filmmaker world depicted film ordinary fascinating scorsese spares no effort show us violence hypocrisy inherent paranoia organised crime yet manages make seductive funny exposed two half hours film three decades criminal history based notorious real life events audience understands characters chose dangerous life paths trading superficial shortlasting glamour prosperity criminal dullness poverty honest citizens scorsese also manages break viewers moralistic inhibitions showing truly revolting material scenes depict personal tragedies broken homes human depravity violence bloodshed murder uncompromising reality manner would make amusing funny audience use ironic soundtrack manipulative shots characters dialogue narrators commentary goodfellas represents new standards black humour would became popular years later tarantino era even not pay attention skills potentially disturbing material becomes eye pleasing entertaining admit scorsese displays talents truly original creative filmmaker first might notice unusual structure plot relatively minor subplot used movies ironic prologue instead single narrator scorsese switches second character narrator middle film switch back original shortly afterwards multiple points views terms narration various subjective shots lengthens ironic distance towards characters situation ironic distance comes extremely effective choice soundtrack nostalgia good old times illustrated easylistening pop songs depression paranoia bad times find expression neurotic rock songs late soundtrack effective used ironic comment almost pastoral easy listening tunes make strong ironic contrast scenes violence bloodshed however thing associated film couple continuos shots feature characters moving large rooms interacting dozens not hundreds people scenes although require great skill patience shootings became popular among directors fragmentary character screenplay not straight plot instead bases film series loosely connected vignettes gives another interesting opportunity scorsese uses structure film experiment successful experiments hilarious day life segment near end film another essential element goodfellas large superb collection great acting talents respectable among robert de niro character happen quiet businesslike member criminal trio gets overshadowed two friends colleagues joe pesci deserved oscar supporting role homicidal psychopath tommy lines including adlibs probably represent memorable element film ray liotta although equally talented perhaps not look best choice narrator nominal hero film liottas henry hill looks somewhat hollywoodised glamorous among bunch lowlevel street thugs liotta hand improves general impression realistic menacing portrayal drug addiction lorraine bracco hand effective believable karen hill wife gradually descends moral cesspool husband paul sorvino also effective patriarch mafioso among supporting cast memorable chuck low pestering smalltime gangster

ladies gentlemen independence day title starship troopers surprisingly entertaining realize gave last years scifi hit star rating spell powerful first hour subsequent viewings feel independence day really not great seemedthough still give positive review starship troopers hand mocking sense humor knowing perfectly well ridiculous may seem result starship troopers exciting energetic lively science fiction film fact probably could never get tired watching film starship troopers reminiscient star wars another kickass space opera reinvented scifi drama altogether starship troopers no star wars comes quite close easiest assessment would call film star wars generous film perhaps science fiction film comes along mix humor romance effectively warring races essence science fiction equivolence pulp fiction easiest way write review film would compare science fiction films may starship troopers not quite original film persay director paul verhoeven gives film kickthealiensasses style style except forced likely cause smith major role new star wars simple basic plot mankind vs alien species alien species question bugs seemingly advanced civilization arachnidtype insects however underlying morals starship troopers fleshed deadly accuracy sometimes morals buried bloody violence intense action scenes quiet moments realize starship troopers something tell us civilization likely morals overpowered quickly forgotten time movie ends doubt verhoeven intended film thoughtprovoking film event film surprisingly average extremely refreshing watch scifi war film actually root human side something independence day never achieved starship troopers begins satirical portrayal strange join army ads mixing webbased interface summations events refreshingly original stating would like know short news bulletins give film immediate sense humor know not take seriously however also witness murder several troopers battle gory yet funny way witnessing slaughter film jumps back one year setup saw introduced johnny rico casper van dien carmen ibanez denise richards rico flirts carmen sending messages computer terminals school classrooms however carmen not interested rico becoming pilot however another classmate dizzy flores dina meyer eye rico unfortunately rico not interested dizzy setup rather cliched result setup still fun watch carmen signs become starship trooper result rico signs result dizzy signs everyone assigned certain position academy carmen gets pilot position wanted carl jenkins neil patrick harris psychic gets position training program rico left lowest class starship troopers mobile infantry main story follows rico trials relationships reality found watching space version melrose place better special effects hour film war begins sense tension grew audience watched film first hour may funny sometimes unintentionally setup grew care flat characters no matter hard tried not like characters gorgeous looks call superficial must following training sessions many dramas many mention troopers sent war bugs live planet klendathu planet consists dirt rock pretty much nothing else many dramas occur war finally troopers realize something behind bugs attacks sort intelligence masterminds defense troopers ordered locate brain capture hopefully left plot vague possible starship troopers not plot special effects gory violence director verhoeven known nudie film showgirls basic instinct returns scifi days gave us good films like total recall verhoeven likes push envelope mpaa despite violence comic book feel gives film sense falsehood starship troopers extremely violent gore years event horizon rating well deserved hopefully parents not allow year old children see guess verhoevens target audience male group film testosterone level charts chiseled men beautiful women despite superficial elements starship troopers also creates world made star wars successful watching film never second guess characters decisions seem perfectly clear thankfully no hero punching aliens face gives flat characters depth identify cast starship troopers quite annoying begin soon grow casper van dien chiseled facial features tan skin make girls swoon guys come across artificial fortunately van dien worst cast despite hard tries come real character dina meyer much better job fleshing character dizzy extremely likeable denise richards also good job scenes well done jake busey gary buseys son gives wonderfully funny performance provides one biggest laughs film neil patrick harris remember doogie howser little wooden slightly place rest cast however give good performance michael ironside gives best performance film teacher one arm performance rises rest perhaps character developed think ironsides presence screen unfortunately no particular cast member gives starmaking performance bad material could made many cast members stars director verhoeven main star film direction fast unrelentless never slows pace makes wild ride writer edward neumeier adapted screenplay book robert heinlein writing usually funny sometimes corny dialogue smart not smart not required know everything plot holes left unanswered thankfully not intended notice really not except one lingered mind quite amazingly wars romance going screenplay manages include surprising governmental issues fact governmental changes seem fairly plausible adds another layer story moral debate characters quite surprising find film genre even surprising amount humor included carnage not laughed loud even comedies oh special effects first rate starship troopers rated graphic scifi violence gore language nudity believe say not take young kids see film extremely violent fact probably violent film year however old enough see starship troopers guaranteed entertain long time since cheered heros also cheering bad guys still dream see scifi film alien race destroys mankind take world would entertaining

alien alien film seen theaters saw years old must admit not like course expecting aliens believe fault order appreciate alien need see aliens also wipe away expectations predecessor james camerons aliens action film many people consider best series among group alien extremely entertaining film critics bashed originality many thought final chase scene went long many others thought film much dialogue not enough action untrue film quite bit action dialogue essential wellwritten chase sequence long not overly long creating quite bit suspense confusion perhaps watching alien video helped big screen overwhelmed something normally not see dark film language extremely harsh always figured alien series rely smart dialogue instead moronic profanities not get wrong not saying films eliminate swearing film substitutes dialogue profane remarks gets rather distracting however since seeing realize swearing mainly aspect restrained hatred characters result alien flaw albeit major one underdeveloped characters never really care get feeling many scenes cut order shorten length movie two characters liked course one lt ripley sigourney weaver although gotten know two films character dr clemens charles dance like inevitable occurs alien begins exactly aliens left prologue alien pure cinematic achievement director david fincher directed music videos chance alien entry without using single line dialogue unless count computer warnings fincher sets entire film impressive aspect fincher shows seconds film cutting title card see lt ripley little girl cryogenic compartments title shot

ripley asks see dead bodies cremated cremation scene one powerful impressive alien films featuring monologue dillon charles dutton prisoner found god movie cuts back forth ceremony dogs demise one memorable moments speech reflects exactly going dog alien succeeds fincher normally injects lot symbolism films easily see becoming next stanley kubrick alfred hitchcock fact mixture fincher knows exactly film film figure one directors complete control films alien riddled symbolic speeches metaphorical images fincher creates best scenes entire alien franchise many people criticized finchers filming death scene ripley reveal nothing saying looking fake enjoy relish portrayal showing ripley fall slow motion nice touch actually not showing hit vat iron great deal symbolism derived feel would spoiled mood entire film actually shown splash molten iron however people seem want witness ripley die creates paradox character not want see die killed one surprises film not plan spoiling review every alien film comes several memorable moments seem stick forever alien course moment alien burst kanes stomach aliens showdown alien ripley machine alien several memorable terrific shot involving alien ripley ripley pushed wall alien stands inches away not kill shocker later leads surprise ending fincher apparently loves use closeups actors faces michael douglas clown faceoff game style shaving actors hair thing look faces many critics not like actors bald makes complete sense taken context plot alien works take context story try compare predecessors finchers turn seems bit gloomy dark though not always bad thing plot pretty much rehash first two films major twists setup several different characters one one picked however first two tons arsenal especially camerons film alien takes place planet devoid human life except rundown prison result no weapons found creates lot tension although must admit fincher could added lot suspense alien film alien worst series extremely wellmade motion picture lot merits not unfortunate thing surrounding second sequel onedimensional characters never really emotionally involved screen characters hardcore criminals really could care less despite ripley central figure important care even though began act like one guys technical side film remarkable better two previous versions camerons version pumped action film massive artillary fincher uses brilliant camera angles terrific lighting moody sets cinematography alex thomson well done terrific chase sequence towards end movie confusion ending draws viewer confused actors chased around yellows reds oranges lights create dark mood create lot suspense shadows dance walls yet shadows could easily alien alien different predecessors time around swiftness alien quite intense camera likes take perspective alien racing characters sets quite incredible reminiscient nostromo alien narrow corridors labrynthine hallways well constructed sets appear future not far future one set pieces even aids destruction alien nothing surprising sigourney weaver turns yet another good performance equaling portrayal ripley aliens snubbed oscars one mainly film critical bomb reactions far realistic film crying loss little child risked life saving previous encounter quite touching really charles dutton strong performance one inmates brink actually caring charles dance turns nice lowkey performance result cared immediately lance henriksen makes brief appearance bishop ii entertaining aliens rest cast pretty stale though pete postlethwaite sticks due recent turns usual suspects lost world alien rated strong violence language sex although flaws alien highly entertaining rich symbolism film reminds much fun spot metaphorical images throughout movie kubrick may moral message throughout films fincher relies cinematic devices bring meanings film like finchers reminds us okay film sacrifice quality quantity final scene fact tells us society become critical

wake smashing success rumble bronx looking likely jackie chan films see american release rumor one films drunken master ii version copy laserdisc widescreen bilinguallysubtitled hong kong films days availability united states limited films must either purchased via pirates sought asian distributors tai seng subtitling copy slightly hard read letters white bit small although american release almost certainly dubbed review subtitled version please keep mind reading review help decide whether go see fair must admit never fond periodpiece martial arts moviesthe ones set nebulous china distant not distant past perhaps seen filmed inferior stock either butchered dubbing allbutillegible subtitling perhaps plots tend similar many cases nonexistant fact many get wrapped subplots seem forget main plot entirely minutes end matter might jackie chan films modern settings armour god rumble bronx etc tend spectacular stunts often involving large motor vehicles large explosions whereas period pieces simply martial arts said must turn right around say drunken master ii remarkable exception one better martial arts films seen quite enjoyed surprised well drunken master ii young man named wong feihong played jackie chan master drunken boxing style kung fu learned style uncertain father wong keiying ti lung steadfast opposition feihongs practicing rather normal style kung fu apparently feihong sort figure chinese folklore rather like paul bunyan americans heard little could quite well wrong leave analysis people know better one friends points character wong feihong also featured upon time china movies not yet seen plot drunken master ii somewhat hazy plots many films watching jackie chan film odds not expecting something order war peace story seems revolve around evil foreigners spiriting away ancient chinese relics hence chinas cultural heritage overworking underpaying beating chinese workers nearby steel mill however plot merely serves framework main story filmfeihongs perpetual struggle win girlfriend supplicate father keep pregnant mother played anita mui fighting keep getting beaten evil foreigner thugs macguffin drives plot precious antique jade imperial seal taken away evil foreigners beginning feihong accidentally steals trying recover identicallywrapped box containing medicinal ginseng father bringing back customer process clashes another thief trying seal ends instead ginseng feihong narrowly avoids getting caught seal evil foreigners lackies thanks timely intervention generals son cameo appearance andy lau would later take starring role drunken master iii comedic chaos ensues back wong household feihong mother attempt come replacement missing ginseng goes plot thickens later feihongs girlfriend maneuvers kung fu match rival feihong thief revealed loyalist manchu officer trying recover seal stop evil foreigners attacked en masse another grand kungfu movie tradition think already spent time plot really deserves let us move real draw jackie chan movies action plenty martial arts action found movie course kung fu film expected however not another kung fu movie one jackie chan fight stunt choreography jackie chan genius primary martial arts style featured film drunken boxing form kung fu attempts draw adversary guard making seem like fellow using drunk purposes film least drunken boxers fight better actually intoxicated fine line drunk enough drunk stupor normal circumstances idea someone staggering around looking sloshed managing fight effectively even incredibly might seem rather stupid jackie pulls flair kung fu sequences intricate staging execution pointless try describe paper say fightsespecially big climactic fight endin make movie worth watching another thing drunken master ii going stunt work even without motor vehicles well not counting train remarkable stunts film among things jackie dives balcony table crawls across hot coals not least twice count outtake shown credits quicktime movies stunts found www movie database unlike american films stunts not faked drunken master ii stars several veteran actors hong kong movie scene including jackie ti lung better tomorrow anita mui heroic trio series rumble bronx performances firstrate especially comes comedy parts film scene feihong mother conspire literally behind feihongs fathers back cover missing ginseng root hilarious scene feihongs mother revealed pregnant threatening hurt order draw husbands anger away feihong jackie developed knack physical comedy sort mastery years fine form drunken master ii far cinematography concerned certainly works film nothing spectacular least dozen times better old kung fu movies picture crisp clear one thing find particularly worthy mention least copy screen wider film ever seen videotape beforealmost whole screen blocked watch bigscreen tv movie theater utter shame film eventually panandscanned american video release drunken master ii shows full potential period piece kung

walt disney productions bought novel lloyd alexander called black cauldron sword sorcery tale studio bringing book screen studios fondest dream miller entitled executive producer promised would proved projects micheal eisner executives arrived disney animation studio animators struggling complete black cauldron time things gone really rocky animation department many studios old men retired died therefore animators suffered hard time making film originally budgeted million costs raised million constant changes everything finally released june black cauldron greeted praising reviews critics somehow film flopped film rated pg film although disneyfied lloyd alexanders chronicles prydain film based much scarier darker disneys previous efforts rescuers fox hound probably many people considered scary stayed away addition critics rejected no heart unmemorable compared disney animated features whatever real reason black cauldron financial disaster grossing million failure film grounded studios animation department exiled animation team annex buildings nearby glendale seemed like animated features would no longer become part studios reputation next two disney animated features great mouse detective oliver company although little lighthearted black cauldron not much better although oliver company grossed much black cauldron great mouse detective little mermaid studio regain reputation successful animated features black cauldron rereleased cities temporary time title taran magic cauldron finally studio locked film film vault denied ever even released might ask black cauldron really bad movie people seen film not think fact many people calls buena vista home video requesting film course denied seemed like black cauldron would never released video september disney released black cauldron video united kingdom people imported video england converted ntsc including not seen film yet included got quite treat people bootleg copies black cauldron noticed scene horned king raises army deathless warriors seconds ghoulish looking skeletons slightly trimmed film would get rating uk rating means universal suitable ages kinda like version somewhere online team diehard black cauldron fans signed petition said bring back black cauldron disney finally decided release video united states time rumors online made video would trimmed like uk video would get rating would add songs rumors put rest walt disney company announced black cauldron would released pg rated version even still finally released us reaction mixed felt indeed cut felt not minor criticisms seemed laughable since film absent thirteen years finally available saw movie first time converted ntsc video not expect much fact heard many mediocre things not think film would ever good film much surprise saw first minutes film asking film everyone saw one flopped box office one critics filmgoers alike called bad movie not seem like instead classic right film wonderful cast characters taran grant bardsley assistant pig keeper would rather warrior pigkeeper storys hero critics said taran not likeable opposite true brave loyal eventually learns lesson friendship later likeable character not likeable character film gurgi john biner lovable little uh thing remains loyal taran even though not quite hit first another likeable character bad guy comic henchman dwarf named creeper phil fondacairo loyal films imaginative sinister villain horned king voiced gruesomely john hurt yet also fears neck characters including sidekicks spunky sweet princess named eilonwy comic bard fflewdurr flamm three comically wicked witches hide dark secret although pleasant likeable not quite well rounded story adventurous one quest involving mystical pig hen wen black cauldron army deathless ones everything hooking opening spectacular finale elmer bernsteins music also tells story perfectly dark yet calming manner animation surprisingly good considering film created darkest time studios even though occasional effects not quite good like ground opening black cauldron rises earth animation overall top notch overall film entertaining endeavor fans unfamiliar lloyd alexander chronicles prydain get kick one except young kids extremely scary scenes darker disneys films although consider stampede sequence lion king frollo observing esmeralda fires hell hunchback notre dame scary main reason film rated pg fans familiar lloyd alexander series recognize differences novel movie even though not ingredients true disney film film classic right deserves far better chance given

heartfelt course know comet impact surface title alone suggests previews actually show absoltuely no tension drawn attempt stop comet know not work director mimi leder came successful tries direction episodes hit television show er major film debut peacemaker pathetic heartless action film well time leder outdid creating film worse one suggestion ms leder please stay away big screen least action genre much blame placed leder directly pace disastrously throughout film given subtitles tell us much time passed goes months weeks hours literally feels like lapsed time taking place realtimeit boring course leder not blame screenwriters michael tolkin bruce joel rubin crafted simplistic story gets worse time starts promising soon turns deadly audience anyway chock full cheesy one liners

enough forgiveable not forgiveable actually humans walk surface give break ya course much hyped collision comet earth well far spectacular makes independence day look brilliant water rushing towards land effective hits continent effects turn ridiculous cgi water used looks bad heard laughs audience shrieks fact may even recommend film want see bad effects actually get days think visual effects not improved along comes film show really one thing struck wrong note concerning mimi leders direction also influences actors leder loves show actors faces moments terror reminded another action director renny harlin die hard cliffhanger harlin succeeds shows faces victims realistic situations leder likes flaunt peoples fears via faces instead coming sympathetic leder seems sadist one moment astronaut flying space enough warrant response audience leder wants go farther shows us persons face drifting space one cheapest ways ellicit emotional response audience one not going fooled another note leders film picks pace last fifteen minutes comet actually impacts pace pick emotional moments shown watch people cry loved ones obvious emotional mostly big trick rope viewers feeling characters not work anyway actors much given leoni bad boys tvs naked truth best film given meatiest role character made stronger leonis presence grow care robert duvall energetic fun watch character turned shreds plot elijah wood also comes rather successfully still not many good roles wood stick drama talented stuff vanessa redgrave barely acknowledgeable performance enhanced strong presence screen

film critics morals unwritten laws ethical movie critic would follow naturally not want go film preconceived notions pretty tough something accomplish secondly along line not prejudge film stars director etc difference well first one would go film thinking going dumb going good would affect viewing movie sounds looks dumb not expecting much second hand simply assuming bad good personal grudge film company made disney oh merchandising ploy actors jim carreys go stink director not good biased viewpoint opposed first impression viewpoint make sense ok comparing not kind along lines compare certain actor director even composers credibility one film another involved really fair sure sequels expect accept comparisons lot jackie brown example fair take review turn comparison pulp fiction quentin tarantino directed wrote screenplay think tell good critic able view film average joe jane viewpoint still taking account artistic integrity behind film sometimes tough acting superb bored loved sooooo cheezy might used describe film contradictions critic weigh sides come suitable balanced critique important better extremely well shot acted film boring really amateurish film wanna go back getting back point philosophy comparing films fair works reflecting public wants know anyway every average person interested film likely ask compare pulp fiction critic already responsible ask question jackie brown stars pam grier blaxploitation heroine likely make big comeback thanks role title character tarantinos pulp fiction big part responsible john travoltas sudden revival movie

actually fan original liveactiondisney flick name starring hayley mills twice pair twins separated birth divorcing parents never come contact parents never meet everyone know feel remakes especially films happen enjoy fallacy unless going either capture exact spirit original something different maybe even wrack brain come gasp new idea remake not originally top viewing list actually quite opposite contemporary liveactiondisney films not one favorties anyway usually unfunny alienating big fat bore least anyone age iq one however shockingly not bad fact actually good not original good great not necessarily retread original capture exact spirit become entertaining exact reasons original entertaining cute innocent fun pretty killer plot endlessly fun follow along lead star immensely appealing parents also immensely appealing repeating cute innocent fun nothing risque save plot idea separating twins denying truth years ominously selfish precisely point movie aimed directly either kids adults want remember original young adults want remember like kid personally somewhere second third vividly remember taste movies not weird diverse names godard kubrick not even glimmer right eye back would tune every sunday night couple years see abcs wonderful world disney would show liveaction andor madefortv disney flick hour per week remember mom taking sister along friends mothers see rereleased disney films like lady tramp pinnochio sadly remember every single christmas without fail barage childrens animated halfhour shows made exclusively christmas season would not dare missing even remember seeing madefortv parent trap ii tv one night seen one saw original parent trap late childhood movie deals issue divorce deals disneyized version playful witty charming saw first time right never experienced part childhood would probably dismiss would probably new version movie not seen original perfect age watching could remember fun watch disney film divorce started get thinking possibilities seeminglyperfect parents splitting affected adolescence also brushed fear smooth stroke pointed even fuckedup situations things could always work well manipulate things bit least better new version also charming way new cast contemporary feel first time awhile liveactiondisney flick tone not corny condescending right moments would otherwise seem corny actually affecting safe kind way first time since original film kids actually know better foolish adults story basically classic repeated almost many times kurosawas seven samurai pair twins played lindsay lohan like played hayley mills original separated birth divorcing parents one annie sent live mother natasha richardson resembling mother vanessa redgrave ever noticed london lives parents devoted foppish butler simon kunz works swingin fashion designer grows refined classy also keen knowledge sports pokerplaying hallie sent northern california father dennis quaid live vineyard pseudomaid lisa ann walter grows rugged yet charming meet camp one annie wants go become rugged feud look alltoo similar thus tight competition results nasty pranks winds seclusion together private outoftheway cabin become friends learn eachother know everything concoct scheme switch places one meet parent heard learn eachothers lives detail make sure look alike requires hair cutting notoriously earpiercing scene like kiddie version hypodermic needle scene pulp fiction end summer comes switch hope best lindsay lohan not necessarily copy acting style hayley mills original comes appealing though add couple new things makes california twin little appealing london twin bit frank snobbish snotty proper original respectively also adds american british accent one one faking accent throughout really take notice see fake ones accents not exactly perfect also incredibly appealing not merely cute especially notable since first feature film know notorious child actors especially first films makes great protagonist helps supporting cast equally appealing dennis quaid fact not likable decade big dumb smile near cocky attitude made notable actor past not mr meg ryan ditto natasha richardson except not ever likable period two make winning couple maybe not winning maureen ohara late brian keith original still work film instead bickering ensued original film adds another dimension another angle characters amiss original opening credits see glimpses courtship qe fall quickly madly love eachother back together films smarmy scenes come actually sentimental great way not migraineinducing way many films brings new parent trap level entertainment not really existed since well original film years ago still money best liveactiondisney flick time form intelligence wit makes plot points otherwise standard villainous love interest subplot golddigging sharon stone type played elaine hendrix deliciously tormented twins later film treat instead bore like original film transcends crap well could case point takes two starring olsen twins treats children smart ones adults silly ones not way around everything knows exactly charming without biting chew however comparison original could bit better certain scenes work well not nearly well worked original liked way parents fought past dilemnas fought falling love better liked watching two old flames getting back together bottle wine somehow feuding always cinematic pleasing mere reminscing lesson extracted howard hawkscary grant films yesteryear much film transcends mere cutedom compared original film almost drowns cutedom original though not gritty far stylized suitable adult audiences young audiences remake may never nearly great classic original film least knows treat source material dignity respect create virtually effects without bordering plagerism petty annoyances

good long since good old fashioned thriller mostly everything goes right audience wrong characters even longer since saw thriller actually shock cared characters not merely judged actually allowed human foibles flaws strengths emerge radiantly would saw least couple decades even far back great hitchcock thrillers though hardly comparing simple plan say rear window strangers train yet almost good simple yet strangely complex astonishingly rewarding instead moving plot point plot point merely laying theymightbecaught overtones instead concerns moral corruption depths greed protagonists go without ever judging either evil even immoral elegantly directed sam raimi yes simple plan concerns discovery crashed plane within bag full millions dollars upright moderately financially stable working man bill paxton dimwitted brother billy bob thornton drinking buddy brent briscoe without anyone around possibility no one would come looking three debate debate finally reach decision yes keep authorities possible owners cash come looking generally not flaunt anything not want flaunt keep stored away custody paxton possibilites circumstance much diverse could endlessly play cat mouse authorities could try fight rightful owners either villainous could fight amongst simple plan though borrows little little tiff cops subplot involving alleged fbi agent chilling gary cole bit inside feuding austin powers would say not necessarily bag baby admired film makes far superior unique thriller successfully able cake eat effectively involves traditional thriller cliches like ones mentioned time involves deeply way characters become morally corrupt price pay think happiness black duffle bag steps taken neatly cover things subsequent steps go miserably awry film choses never loose sight covering things extent characters slowly losing souls humanity one early scene paxton thornton make trip back plane return money not look like stolen not bad idea thornton screws continuously throughout movie paxton major coveringup read homicide instead quick murder immeadiate handswashing raimi shows lengthy painful shot lowangle onto paxtons face tries sift emotions reach conclusion similar shot afterwards paxton watching murder committing taking horror also wonderfully effective previous shot even better morally complex gutwrenching short probably best piece direction raimis ever done demonstrating sometimes simplest way something yields best results proof watch persona sex scene witness may best scene ingmar bergmans ever done film hardly stops follows completely rarely loses sight characters humanity depletion thereof yet also moves step step graceful method never feel like film merely stamping plot points story time comes paxton start becoming selfish thus diabolical aid pregnant wife played bridget fonda pal raimi soon horror situation escalating tragic heights least two grand shootouts least one may one greatest shootouts cinema history arrive not come masochistic delight cringeinducing horror one actually sinking chair mantra not streeming head fact film getting many comparisons coens superior forget fargo many similar moments manic insanity attributed major amount subtlety restraint directors direct hands would overthetop distractedness imagine suppose robert rodriguez directing seeing evil dead films would hardly assume raimi would able pull something like although moments film easily dubbed raimi moments rifleshot notwithstanding instead raimi directs maturity gentle touch easily letting story characters coexist still letting traditional raimi elements come like offbeat comic touches particularly billy bob thorntons character jacob brilliant creation dimwittedness often hilarious film every line uttered greeted howling laughter authenticity performance strangely enough makes sure not totally laughing chuckles gets not necessarily ones fullcondescension thornton damn real jacobs multidimensional character stupid see not much flaw strength character simplicity endearing many acts commits strong inner strength belief system primarily towards middle bud coconspirator begins make heavy waves concerning money final third film spends much time many touches upon character not thornton also screenwriter scott smith adapting book way great particularly admired back story old high school girlfriend told thornton sincerity acception cruel story reversed nearsweetness strength saddened character thornton absolutely brilliant performance far best performance ever given proof best character actor contemporary cinema not believe go back watch wonderful performance primary colors performance would nominated oscar not year easily able slip character make completely utterly believable brings much weight film character actors difficult picturing anyone else role rest cast great paxtons declining working man chelcie ross amiable town sheriff even fonda shows talents nicely complaints film plot almost simplistic times seems much like exercise like cruel test humanity still pays attention humanity involved occasional narration usually annoying narration used extreme caution especially trying set things andor express emotions not raimi watch first murder scene thing usually go wrong movie ending basically amiss not reveal way cruel much outsider setup appearance plane not already much anyway film deals much intimately humanity characters involved wrong ending imagine charactercontrolled ending otherwise like crime punishment police caught instead breaking confessing not comparing simple plan dostoevsky ending work despite protestations something incessantly nagging unsatisfying no qualms happy clam ignore go day despite mere claims make no mistake completely utterly edge seat throughout even sometimes curdling situations occured not kind gore factor thankfully minimal film places characters situations gives painful things overcome frankly not seen much like quite awhile least not since previous worthy hitchcockian masterpiece

form critical analysis friend fellow film critic ted prigge said review phantom menace even write review never mind fact waiting new star wars movie since seven years old never mind fact everyone internet already dissected discussed movie even released never mind much going movie terms plot action special effects longterm story analyze every aspect would take lot time energy still would not cover everything also like ted reviews try review way different usual reviews instead write casually possible talking directly reader begin analyzing specific aspects film many general significant factors must considered get specifics film skip next four paragraphs made obvious last several years another trilogy films produced account missing initial three installments star wars series first films actually episode four not one george lucas creator series probably assumed people know firstproduced trilogy star wars empire strikes back return jedi actually second trilogy chronologically media interviews past explained movies made order not recall reasons new film writer director also assumed viewers least vaguely familiar storylines significant plot points first trilogy err second trilogy well know mean order review thorough many significant points must mentioned unfortunately may serve spoilers proceed caution critics note one personal policy not intentionally analyze spoilers would like reviews able make sense reader viewing film reviewed would nearly impossible film justice without breaking rule critics note reviewing film also breaks universal critics law reviewing movies roger ebert coined not movie many outside factors come play films plot significance part trilogy considering modern society would difficult not impossible simply review film completely autonomous story first catalog know film even going know young anakin skywalker grow become evil ruler darth vader also father luke skywalker lead successful revolution empire know obiwan ben kenobi trainer anakin ways force attempts become jedi knight would fail thus anakin would fall dark side also know something force kind universal force determines fate manipulated whose minds expanded enough believe feel jedi not know sure history ruling galaxy likely much longer complex government earth one fascinating aspects first three films seemed subtle definite order complexity also seems supposed familiar details story come thousands comic books paperbacks published years since movies ended notably details regarding emperor empire jedi senator last name palpatine not kept star wars paraphernalia years still way know details simply recognizing actor voice least phantom menace first chapter long saga one would assume basic groundwork would laid including history behind major factors series especially force jedi knights unfortunately film opposite simply builds top must history long detailed could never explained not liked aspect film one reasons falls short greatness going tell story beginning tell beginning possible trilogy complete could another trilogy episodes clarify back story even digress said much yet not even touched specifics film necessary disclaiming elements go show vast story star wars series individual film get movie not unlike three come know love since late similarity films helps keep spirit series familiar time seems flaw filmmaking process

spring action within minutes hero jedi fighting lives films story begins move along film not one specific plot works manner films series get one miniplot adventure top another many
