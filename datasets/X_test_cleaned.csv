statue investigation soon called however frankie starts exhibiting signs stigmata person inflicted wounds like jesus christ father kiernan initially skeptical frankie story considering atheist witnesses stigmata attacks dedicates finding going eventually begins suspect boss cardinal houseman jonathan pryce concealing something could bring catholic church turns dead priest working translation fifth gospel excommunicated new rupert wainwright music video mean film stigmata sort film starts ok gets worse indeed would good music video interesting five minutes not sure wainwright trying prove endless parade slowmotion doubleexposure extreme closeups whoaaaaaa fact swelled head director hollywood yes film school camera trickery interesting little eventually becomes headacheinducing film needed second audio track played dialogue wainwright screaming audience see look excellent director maybe would explain decided start half scenes slowmotion shots water dripping reverse included random superfluous shots egg frying ooh scary underlying meaning behind camera trickery not see thought safe get involved story comes doubleexposure shot two patricia arquettes collapsing bed no reason whatsoever arrrrrrrghhhh superfluous camera trickery would not bother stigmata story characters remotely engaging though wainwrights vanity certainly not help seem given nearly unworkable script plot continuity character development need case point frankie page character assume supposed identify sympathize not given back story character reason like extent character development seems hardworking hairdresser somehow afford cavernous apartment top floor building kind cute let us start bleeding fact clearly not brightest bulb drawer not help either according frankie page first thing receiving mysterious wounds wrists back go clubbing sure makes sense arquette byrne pryce give old college try characters onedimensional appear sleepwalking scenes arquette byrne probably supposed sexually charged fall almost embarrassingly flat setup romantic subplot clumsily handled almost reaches point becoming laughable even though frankie pages life falling apart eyes still finds time hit priest wanders hair salon even curiously seems interested advances father andrews religious doubt pops suddenly seems silly dramatic pryce may well wear curled mustache cackle get pretty depth cardinal houseman afforded trust not revealing anything telling pryce turns villain worse faced dull characters prospect annoying camera tricks loud music jammed throats contend story starts one direction veers another another ends totally incomprehensible first film not even bother explain simple plot details frankie get stigmata merely touching rosary come atheist like chosen since father andrew mentions devout believers ever received stigmata actually not sure frankie posessed supposedly stigmata occurs one posessed holy spirit film later posessed dead priest later evil spirit think one answer question course simple possessing entity scene determined whichever effects flashy camera work mr wainwright wants use time furthermore ending ridiculously neat little wrapup filmmakers compound problem ultimately turning film diatribe catholic church research gospel st thomas find not suppressed church film seems claim readily available local library nothing catholics need worry though stigmatas religion offbase not confused anything remotely resembling real catholic church wanted portray catholic priests mobsters gone allout equipped sharkskin suits tommy guns would far interesting not catholic fact care much catholic church cartoonish misrepresentation film not considered realistic means rare see film fails many levels stigmata not thoughtprovoking though would like definitely not scary though pretends not sure tried pass horror film absolutely nothing scary story maybe attempt cover fact none scenes dramatic weight whatsoever initial shock seeing arquette covered blood dulled fact happens like many films mtv generation one suffers overkill much overdone stigmata eventually no effect audience leaving us pick films many flaws also still trying figure quotation take gospel st thomas earthshattering finally hear saying sounds like something every fiveyearold learns first day sunday school means flash whole film really much ado nothing dog

let open one confession love cop movies adore unwavering near foolish passion actually one first line see one tough cop starring smirkiest baldwin brothers steven good well good baldwins steven seagal impression confused answer resounding no let clarify not love cop movie not keen smug buddy cop flicks vogue slowly gulp returning thanks jackie chan chris tucker partial gritty earthy cop dramas like serpico donnie brasco french connection problem films come along often george bush makes cogent point whenever true cop movie hit multiplexes come running towards like eager puppy inevitably leave head bowed tripping squiggly tail cop movies transform moron willing shell movie called one tough cop actually sounds lot like wiseguy spinoff no truth sucker barren streets gritty graffiti strewn modernist jungle dangerous criminals lurk cops like modern day knights must shield us iniquitous clutches yes corny awfully boys clubish guessing precisely feelings come little tots us boys brought create wars gi joes enact cops robbers cowboy indian fantasies etc best gritty cop films tap gleeful adolescent fantasies heighten turning existential nightmare thin moral lines psychological chaos adult tastes not changed drastically sure get cerebral high emotional complexities krzysztof kieslowski film still delight promise guy film could potentially bring cops whore corrupt ones ooh one

performance skyrocketed career level brad pitt currently resides since hatched mere two years prior release prince city not provide answer not though judging recent roles tripe like deep rising dead

soak action scenes transition rapidly one next building layers tension rarely holds reaction shots instead clicks away precisely moment character stops yakking lumets worst tendency one many film makers especially oliver stone tend overuse relies little heavily actors shouting lines presumably order ratchet tension not much problem night falls manhattan lumets recent cop lawyer endeavor movie nearly gave ulcer watching though late lumet made several really awful career choices maybe treat get together drink something recent completely unnecessary remake gloria sustaining tension film runs minutes not one dull spot formula pictures like best simplistic hollywood often forgets easy make kinds pictures even tolerable course cop movies not popular anymore yes buddy cop flicks popular like extended sitcoms gunfire amid punch lines look average hollywood action movies flicks bloated full unnecessary fat like boring love interest serves no purpose stall action demonstrate hero not gay

gets rather heady times credit screenwriters zwick lawrence wright menno meyjes not underestimate intelligence audience not know tone inflection something else denzel washington way spitting dialog makes whatever says sound great combined innate acting ability experience playing midlevel authority figure makes performance siege convincing enjoyable annette bening gives one assertive portrayals female character seen recently chemistry shares washington palpable somewhat unfortunate characters fortitude broken certain point allows us watch bening play little range bruce willis pretty much relegated toughguy role always standing straight permanent scowl fixed upon face however tension exists devereaux hubbard major drive behind films development notable tony shalhoub plays fbi agent frank haddad lebanese immigrant role calls evidencing kind filial pride heritage contempt race might interfere integration american society difficult say least shalhoub naturalness almost reach touch perhaps best known role antonio cab driver nbc sitcom wings shalhoub gained notoriety dramatic abilities wonderful film big night whereas denzel washington seems edward zwicks favorite actor directed washington glory courage fire james horner seems favorite composer therefore found odd zwick chose prolific scorewriter graeme revell seven films year already horner siege realized film contained lot arabianthemed music horners record shown propensity scores either neutral ethnicity irishsounding revell good job providing appropriate music punctuate key scenes allowing score enhance movie whole nowhere near intrusive films getting throughout year missteps siege found couple excesses takes example pretty clear throughout film meant thriller action flick unfortunately scene army cuts loose

people enjoy science fiction often faced unpleasant surprises due improper labelling novels stories comic books movies often science fiction aficionados find material previously labelled science fiction pure fantasy supernatural horror rather simple technothriller cases mistakes understandable genre boundaries never clearly marked believe really cases movie labelled science fiction actually happens straight historical epic thing occurred former yugoslavia fifteen years ago national distributors gave treatment right stuff film directed philip kaufman mistake distributors could explained fact official poster film features men space suits right stuff film not even fiction based nonfiction book tom wolfe covering early years american space program plot film begins people heard edwards air force base major test site experimental planes major aim test flights determine ability manned aircraft reach mach speed thus break sound barrier many pilots tried achieve goal many paid lives bravado one quiet pilot chuck eager played sam shaped succeeds thus gives example whole new generation test pilots determined enter history books breaking new speed records ten years later soviets launched sputnik marking beginning space age order regain national prestige us government decides first send man space best air force navy marine pilots recruited program not yeager lacks college education desired allamerican image one critics polls right stuff named one among top films made high position could explained fact kaufmans film looks quite atypical time three hours length epic scope looked suitable age hollywood used make films larger life real reason lies fact made truly remarkable talented filmmaker philip kaufman created reputation using opportunities golden age order create original memorable movies right stuff last swan song era producers allowed directors spend big bucks unusual risktaking artsy projects right stuff unusual lacks many standard elements hollywood film plot almost nonexistent not coherent story featuring many interesting incidents anecdotes shifts focus old generation test pilots embodied yeager new generation astronauts film also lacks conventional protagonist yeager also appears small cameo remains true hero film equal time exposure also given astronauts wives making movie ensemble piece gave opportunity kaufman use multitude great acting talents specialised bit character roles sam shepard great yeager war hero whose greatest achievement breech sound barrier remained obscured history books probably due modesty surface lacks personality compared hyped fortunate astronaut colleagues shepard gives texture character subtle gestures phrases shepards performance followed great acting ed harris cleancut marine future politician john glenn young dennis quaid fine arrogant fighter jock gordo cooper arrogance mirrored friend tragic figure virgil grissom superbly played fred ward always reliable character actor scott glenn provides comic relief navy aviator arguably first american man space alan shepard kaufman left room female talents excel barbara hershey pamela reed veronica cartwright mary jo deschanel great pilots wives royal dano also impressive menacing figure preacher memorable performances belong donald moffat vicepresident lyndon johnson jane dornacker nurse murch great acting talent assembled film mirrored kaufmans superb direction notable methods kaufman uses order suggest passage time beginning film shows test pilots living middle desert virtual unknowns far away strict rules discipline everything seems natural yeager indulge horse riding yards away fastest precious aircraft world setting quite normal important technical problems solved simple chainsaw test pilots not report ribs broken important flights times changing ww alliance ussr replaced cold war natural pilots like yeager must replaced disciplined conventional pilots entire lives become focus media frenzy job subjected strict rules meticulous plans must fight bureaucrats publicityseeking politicians uncaring scientists like former nazi rocket expert werner von braun played scott beach preserve basic human dignity contrast underlined beautifully edited sequence yeager conducts final spectacular test flight absolute obscurity mercury astronauts receive fame fortune although even going space contrasts similar effects achieved kaufmans superb use poetic movie language editing great photography caleb deschanel provides many memorable scenes like funeral desert astronauts suits walking slow motion image would copied many latter films although kaufman enjoyed support nasa american military provided authentic locations period equipment still use special effects order simulate space flights effects excellent still fool audience accustomed cgi real footage earth outer space another fine contribution film oscar awarded musical score bill conti still tremble excitement every time hear accompanied use holst debussy songs used background also provide authentic atmosphere historical period film great cult status well deserved minor flaws mercury astronauts not fleshed enough although played fine actors like lance henriksen film also lacks proper closure hand logical conclusion film landing moon would require film six hours long also critics prone attack film amerocentric hard russians portrayed evil monsters line virulent cold war rhetoric reagans america contemporary interviews kaufman defended approach claiming wanted make film authentic possible order portrayed russians not real life perceived americans early time passed not see astronauts heroes age widespread satellite communications routine space missions men women space suits seen mere maintenance workers young boys want astronauts grow film sentimental reminder times future began perhaps could encourage least follow mercury astronauts footsteps seek new frontiers sky even decide stay earth could still appreciate right stuff extraordinary piece cinema
